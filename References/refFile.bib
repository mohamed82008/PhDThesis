In some cases, it is the trace of the matrix rather than the diagonal that is needed. This paper describes methods for estimating diagonals and traces of matrices in these situations. The goal is to obtain a good estimate of the diagonal by applying only a small number of matrix-vector products, using selected vectors. We begin by considering the use of random test vectors and then explore special vectors obtained from Hadamard matrices. The methods are tested in the context of computational materials science to estimate the diagonal of the density matrix which holds the charge densities.

abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for solving structural topology optimization problems with uncertainty in the magnitude and location of the applied loads and with small uncertainty in the location of the structural nodes. The second type of uncertainty would typically arise from fabrication errors where the tolerances for the node locations are small in relation to the length scale of the structural elements. We first review the discrete form of the uncertain loads problem, which has been previously solved using a weighted average of multiple load patterns. With minor modifications, we extend this solution to include loads described by continuous joint probability density functions. We then proceed to the main contribution of this paper: structural optimization under uncertainty in the nodal locations. This optimization problem is computationally difficult because it involves variations of the inverse of the structural stiffness matrix. It is shown, however, that for small uncertainties the problem can be recast into a simpler but equivalent structural optimization problem with equivalent uncertain loads. By expressing these equivalent loads in terms of continuous random variables, we are able to make use of the extended form of the uncertain loads problem presented in the first part of this paper. The optimization algorithms are developed in the context of minimum compliance (maximum stiffness) design. Simple examples are presented. The results demonstrate that load and nodal uncertainties can have dramatic impact on optimal design. For structures containing thin substructures under axial loads, it is shown that these uncertainties (a) are of first-order significance, influencing the linear elastic response quantities, and (b) can affect designs by avoiding unrealistically optimistic and potentially unstable structures. The additional computational cost associated with the uncertainties scales linearly with the number of uncertainties and is insignificant compared to the cost associated with solving the deterministic structural optimization problem. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Nguyen2011,
abstract = {This paper presents a single-loop algorithm for system reliability-based topology optimization (SRBTO) that can account for statistical dependence between multiple limit-states, and its applications to computationally demanding topology optimization (TO) problems. A single-loop reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) algorithm replaces the inner-loop iterations to evaluate probabilistic constraints by a non-iterative approximation. The proposed single-loop SRBTO algorithm accounts for the statistical dependence between the limit-states by using the matrixbased system reliability (MSR) method to compute the system failure probability and its parameter sensitivities. The SRBTO/MSR approach is applicable to general system events including series, parallel, cut-set and link-set systems and provides the gradients of the system failure probability to facilitate gradient-based optimization. In most RBTO applications, probabilistic constraints are evaluated by use of the first-order reliability method for efficiency. In order to improve the accuracy of the reliability calculations for RBDO or RBTO problems with high nonlinearity, we introduce a new single-loop RBDO scheme utilizing the second-order reliability method and implement it to the proposed SRBTO algorithm. Moreover, in order to overcome challenges in applying the proposed algorithm to computationally demanding topology optimization problems, we utilize the multiresolution topology optimization (MTOP) method, which achieves computational efficiency in topology optimization by assigning different levels of resolutions to three meshes representing finite element analysis, design variables and material density distribution respectively. The paper provides numerical examples of twoand three-dimensional topology optimization problems to demonstrate the proposed SRBTO algorithm and its applications. The optimal topologies from deterministic, component and system RBTOs are compared with one another to investigate the impact of optimization schemes on final topologies. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed to verify the accuracy of the failure probabilities computed by the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract = {In this research, a reliability based topology optimization (RBTO) for structural design methodology using the Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA) method is proposed. More specifically, a decoupled reliability based design optimization (RBDO) approach is utilized, so that the topology optimization is separate from the reliability analysis. In this paper, a maximum allowable displacement failure mode is considered. In this methodology, starting from a continuum design space of uniform material distribution and initial uncertain variable values, a deterministic topology optimization is followed by a reliability assessment of the resulting structure to determine the most probable point of failure (MPP) for the current structure. The MPP is determined with respect to the maximum allowable deflection of the structure when loaded. This is generally a computationally expensive process using traditional techniques due to the large number of design variables associated with topology optimization problem. However, combining the efficient methods of the non-gradient HCA algorithm with the decoupled approach for RBDO aims to reduce this burden. The topology optimization was without constraint in previous applications of the HCA method. To accommodate RTBO, a mechanism for a global constraint for maximum allowable displacement is developed. This paper details the methodology for the six-sigma design of structures using topology optimization. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract = {This article presents an efficient approach for reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) in which the computational effort involved in solving the RBTO problem is equivalent to that of solving a deterministic topology optimization (DTO) problem. The methodology presented is built upon the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method used for solving the deterministic optimization problem. The proposed method is suitable for linear elastic problems with independent and normally distributed loads, subjected to deflection and reliability constraints. The linear relationship between the deflection and stiffness matrices along with the principle of superposition are exploited to handle reliability constraints to develop an efficient algorithm for solving RBTO problems. Four example problems with various random variables and single or multiple applied loads are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach in solving RBTO problems. The major contribution of this article comes from the improved efficiency of the proposed algorithm when measured in terms of the computational effort involved in the finite element analysis runs required to compute the optimum solution. For the examples presented with a single applied load, it is shown that the CPU time required in computing the optimum solution for the RBTO problem is 15-30{\%} less than the time required to solve the DTO problems.

abstract = {A new non-probabilistic reliability-based topology optimization (NRBTO) method for detailed design of continuum structures is proposed in this paper, in which the unknown but bounded (UBB) uncertainties existing in material and external loads are considered simultaneously. Based on the interval set-theoretic model, traditional displacement constraint is transformed into the non-probabilistic reliability format, in which a novel measuring index, namely, the optimization feature distance is defined by a combination of the area-ratio ideas. Thus, the optimal layout issue is converted by the lightweight design problem with displacement reliability constraints. Moreover, the interval parametric vertex approach and the adjoint vector method are also employed to obtain the sensitivity information between the reliability measurement and design variables. By utilizing the method of moving asymptotes (MMA), the optimization problem that is investigated can be solved iteratively. Two engineering examples are eventually presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the methodology that has been developed, and numerical results show that considering the UBB uncertainty effects during the whole procedure of topology optimization may have a significant influence on the final structural configurations.},

The reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) is a powerful and promising methodology for finding the optimum topologies with the uncertainties being explicitly considered, typically manifested by the use of reliability constraints. Generally, a direct integration of reliability concept and topology optimization may lead to computational difficulties. In view of this fact, three methodologies have been presented in this study, including the double-loop approach (the performance measure approach, PMA) and the decoupled approaches (the so-called Hybrid method and the sequential optimization and reliability assessment, SORA). For reliability analysis, the stochastic response surface method (SRSM) was applied, combining with the design of experiments generated by the sparse grid method, which has been proven as an effective and special discretization technique. The methodologies were investigated with three numerical examples considering the uncertainties including material properties and external loads. The optimal topologies obtained using the deterministic, RBTOs were compared with one another; and useful conclusions regarding validity, accuracy and efficiency were drawn.},

abstract = {Robust design has been gaining wide attention, and its applications have been extended to making reliable decisions when designing complex engineering systems in a multidisciplinary design environment. Though the usefulness of robust design is widely acknowledged for multidisciplinary design systems, its implementation is rare. One of the reasons is due to the complexity and computational burden associated with the evaluation of performance variations caused by the randomness (uncertainty) of a system. In this paper, a multidisciplinary robust design procedure that utilizes efficient methods for uncertainty analysis is developed. Different from the existing uncertainty analysis techniques, our proposed techniques bring the features of MDO framework into consideration. The system uncertainty analysis (SUA) method and the concurrent subsystem uncertainty analysis (CSSUA) method are developed to estimate the mean and variance of system performance subject to uncertainties associated with both design parameters and design models. As shown both analytically and empirically, compared to the conventional Monte Carlo simulation approach, the proposed techniques used for uncertainty analysis will significantly reduce the amount of design evaluations at the system level, and therefore improve the efficiency of robust design in the domain of MDO. A mathematical example and an electronic packaging problem are used as examples to verify the effectiveness of these approaches.},

This paper proposes a new reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) approach for the uncertain structural design based on the fuzzy set model, which can be constructed by expert opinions. The formulation of the proposed RBTO is established as a volume minimization problem under constraints established within the possibility context, termed as failure possibility constraints. The computation for the failure possibility constraints in each optimization loop is a double-loop nested problem. Accordingly, the proposed RBTO is a triple-loop nested problem, which is computationally expensive. To improve the computational efficiency, the target performance approach is introduced to the failure possibility constraints, and thus the triple-loop nested problem is reduced to a double-loop nested problem. To further improve the computational efficiency, the interval perturbation method (IPM) is used to estimate the constraints, thereby the calculation for the constraints in each optimization loop becomes deterministic, and the double-loop nested problem is reduced to an approximate single-loop problem. Numerical results on two examples are presented to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methods.},

A common example of a function is the inverse of a large, sparse matrix, which is the focus of this paper. When the evaluation of the function is expensive, the task is computationally challenging because the standard approach is based on a Monte Carlo method which converges slowly. We present a different approach that exploits the pattern correlation, if present, between the diagonal of the inverse of the matrix and the diagonal of some approximate inverse that can be computed inexpensively. We leverage various sampling and fitting techniques to fit the diagonal of the approximation to the diagonal of the inverse. Depending on the quality of the approximate inverse, our method may serve as a standalone kernel for providing a fast trace estimate with a small number of samples. Furthermore, the method can be used as a variance reduction method for Monte Carlo in some cases. This is decided dynamically by our algorithm. An extensive set of experiments with various technique combinations on several matrices from some real applications demonstrate the potential of our method.},

We propose a linear-time randomized algorithm to approximate log-determinants for very large-scale positive definite and general non-singular matrices using a stochastic trace approximation, called the Hutchinson method, coupled with Chebyshev polynomial expansions that both rely on efficient matrix-vector multiplications. We establish rigorous additive and multiplicative approximation error bounds depending on the condition number of the input matrix. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm can provide very high accuracy solutions at orders of magnitude faster time than the Cholesky decomposition and Schur completion, and enables us to compute log-determinants of matrices involving tens of millions of variables.},

The efficiency and robustness of reliability analysis methods are important factors to evaluate the probabilistic constraints in reliability-based design optimization (RBDO). In this paper, a relaxed mean value (RMV) approach is proposed in order to evaluate probabilistic constraints including convex and concave functions in RBDO using the performance measure approach (PMA). A relaxed factor is adaptively determined in the range from 0 to 2 using an inequality criterion to improve the efficiency and robustness of the inverse first-order reliability methods. The performance of the proposed RMV is compared with six existing reliability methods, including the advanced mean value (AMV), conjugate mean value (CMV), hybrid mean value (HMV), chaos control (CC), modified chaos control (MCC), and conjugate gradient analysis (CGA) methods, through four nonlinear concave and convex performance functions and three RBDO problems. The results demonstrate that the proposed RMV is more robust than the AMV, CMV, and HMV for highly concave problems, and slightly more efficient than the CC, MCC, and CGA methods. Furthermore, the proposed relaxed mean value guarantees robust and efficient convergence for RBDO problems with highly nonlinear performance functions.},

However, the evaluation of the failure probabilities of the cost and constraint functions and their gradients, requires integrations over failure regions. To simplify this we introduce an indicator function into the integrand, whereby the integration region becomes the known range of random variables and to alleviate the non-differentiable property of the indicator function, a smooth approximation is adopted to facilitate the sensitivity analysis. Both intrusive and non-intrusive polynomial chaos approaches for uncertainty propagation are employed in the design optimization of linear elastic structures.

For large matrices, direct methods are unfeasible and one must resort to approximations, for example using a conjugate gradient solver combined with Girard's trace estimator (also known as Hutchinson's trace estimator). Here we describe an unbiased estimator of the regularized inverse trace, based on Wilson's algorithm, an algorithm that was initially designed to draw uniform spanning trees in graphs. Our method is fast, easy to implement, and scales to very large matrices. Its main drawback is that it is limited to diagonally dominant matrices {\$}\backslashbL{\$}.},

abstract = {Uncertainty is inherent and unavoidable in almost all engineering systems. Reliability issues stem rightly from the existence of all sorts of uncertainties. In reliability modeling, an appropriate way for dealing with uncertainties and a corresponding reasonable index system for measuring the reliability are essential. The main purpose of this paper is to present a generalized non-probabilistic reliability methodology for analysis and design of structures with bounded uncertainties. The input uncertain parameters are treated as interval variables, and the two representative convex-set models, hyper-rectangle model and hyper-ellipsoid model, are adopted to describe bounded uncertainties. A non-probabilistic reliability measuring system is developed, in which dimensionless non-probabilistic reliability indices are defined in different situations by adopting a similar way as the traditional probabilistic reliability method for structures. The measuring system of reliability is explained in detail and is illustrated schematically. Based on these, a non-probabilistic reliability methodology for structures with uncertain-but-bounded parameters is presented systematically. The fundamental problem of how to construct a convex-set model is briefly discussed by examples and numerical experiments. Four other numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the presented method.},

abstract = {This paper describes a non-probabilistic reliability-based topology optimization method for the design of continuum structures undergoing large deformations. The variation of the structural system is treated with the multi-ellipsoid convex model, which is a realistic description of the parameters being inherently uncertain-but-bounded or lacking sufficient probabilistic data. The formulation of the optimal design is established as a volume minimization problem with non-probabilistic reliability constraints on the geometrically nonlinear structural behaviour. In order to circumvent numerical difficulties in solving the nested double-loop optimization problem, a performance measure-based approach is employed to transform the constraint on the reliability index into one on the concerned performance. In conjunction with an efficient adjoint variable scheme for the sensitivity analysis of reliability constraints, the optimization problem is solved by gradient-based mathematical programming methods. Three numerical examples for the optimization design of planar structures are presented to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method. The obtained optimal solutions show the importance of incorporating various uncertainties in the design problem. Moreover, it is also revealed that the geometrical nonlinearity needs to be accounted for to ensure satisfaction of the reliability constraints in the optimal design of structures with large deformation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The variations of the cross-sectional areas, Young's moduli and applied loads are treated with non-probabilistic ellipsoid convex models. A robustness index for quantitatively measuring the maximal allowable magnitude of system variations is presented, and the design problem is then formulated as to maximize the minimum of the robustness indices for all the concerned design requirements under a given material volume constraint. For circumventing the difficulty associated with the max-min type problem, an aggregate function technique is employed to construct a smooth objective function. The computational scheme for the sensitivity of the robustness index is derived on the basis of optimum sensitivity analysis. The optimization problem is then solved by using the GCMMA optimizer.

abstract = {Because deterministic optimum designs obtained without taking uncertainty into account could lead to unreliable designs, a reliability-based approach to design optimization is preferable using a Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) method. A typical RBDO process iteratively carries out a design optimization in an original random space (X-space) and a reliability analysis in an independent and standard normal random space (U-space). This process requires numerous nonlinear mappings between X- and U-spaces for various probability distributions. Therefore, the nonlinearity of the RBDO problem will depend on the type of distribution of random parameters, since a transformation between X- and U-spaces introduces additional nonlinearity into the reliability-based performance measures evaluated during the RBDO process. The evaluation of probabilistic constraints in RBDO can be carried out in two ways: using either the Reliability Index Approach (RIA), or the Performance Measure Approach (PMA). Different reliability analysis approaches employed in RIA and PMA result in different behaviors of nonlinearity for RIA and PMA in the RBDO process. In this paper, it is shown that RIA becomes much more difficult to solve for non-normally distributed random parameters because of the highly nonlinear transformations that are involved. However, PMA is rather independent of probability distributions because it only has a small involvement with a nonlinear transformation.},

Motivated by the difficulty to perform this analysis when the uncertainty enters into the plant coefficients in a nonlinear fashion, we study a probabilistic approach. In this setting, the uncertain parameters q are random variables bounded in a set Q and described by a multivariate density function f(q). We then pose the following question: Given a performance level, what is the probability that this level is attained? The main content of this paper is to derive explicit bounds for the number of samples required to estimate this probability with a certain accuracy and confidence a priori specified. It is shown that the number obtained is inversely proportional to these thresholds and it is much smaller than that of classical results. Finally, we remark that the same approach can be followed to study several problems in a control system context. For example, we can evaluate the worst-case H∞ norm of the sensitivity function of multi-input multi-output systems or compute $\mu$ when the robustness margin is of interest. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) involves evaluation of probabilistic constraints, which can be done in two different ways, the reliability index approach (RIA) and the performance measure approach (PMA). It has been reported in the literature that RIA yields instability for some problems but PMA is robust and efficient in identifying a probabilistic failure mode in the optimization process. However, several examples of numerical tests of PMA have also shown instability and inefficiency in the RBDO process if the advanced mean value (AMV) method, which is a numerical tool for probabilistic constraint evaluation in PMA, is used, since it behaves poorly for a concave performance function, even though it is effective for a convex performance function. To overcome difficulties of the AMV method, the conjugate mean value (CMV) method is proposed in this paper for the concave performance function in PMA. However, since the CMV method exhibits the slow rate of convergence for the convex function, it is selectively used for concave-type constraints. That is, once the type of the performance function is identified, either the AMV method or the CMV method can be adaptively used for PMA during the RBDO iteration to evaluate probabilistic constraints effectively. This is referred to as the hybrid mean value (HMV) method. The enhanced PMA with the HMV method is compared to RIA for effective evaluation of probabilistic constraints in the RBDO process. It is shown that PMA with a spherical equality constraint is easier to solve than RIA with a complicated equality constraint in estimating the probabilistic constraint in the RBDO process.},

abstract = {During the past decade, numerous endeavors have been made to develop effective reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) methods. Because the evaluation of probabilistic constraints defined in the RBDO formulation is the most difficult part to deal with, a number of different probabilistic design approaches have been proposed to evaluate probabilistic constraints in RBDO. In the first approach, statistical moments are approximated to evaluate the probabilistic constraint. Thus, this is referred to as the approximate moment approach (AMA). The second approach, called the reliability index approach (RIA), describes the probabilistic constraint as a reliability index. Last, the performance measure approach (PMA) was proposed by converting the probability measure to a performance measure. A guide for selecting an appropriate method in RBDO is provided by comparing probabilistic design approaches for RBDO from the perspective of various numerical considerations. It has been found in the literature that PMA is more efficient and stable than RIA in the RBDO process. It is found that PMA is accurate enough and stable at an allowable efficiency, whereas AMA has some difficulties in RBDO process such as a second-order design sensitivity required for design optimization, an inaccuracy to measure a probability of failure, and numerical instability due to its inaccuracy. Consequently, PMA has several major advantages over AMA, in terms of numerical accuracy, simplicity, and stability. Some numerical examples are shown to demonstrate several numerical observations on the three different RBDO approaches.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. An efficient procedure for three-dimensional continuum structural topology optimization is proposed. The approach is based on recycled preconditioning, where multigrid preconditioners are generated only at selected design cycles and re-used in subsequent cycles. Building upon knowledge regarding approximate reanalysis, it is shown that integrating recycled preconditioning into a minimum weight problem formulation can lead to a more efficient procedure than the common minimum compliance approach. Implemented in MATLAB, the run time is roughly twice faster than that of standard minimum compliance procedures. Computational savings are achieved without any compromise on the quality of the results in terms of the compliance-to-weight trade-off achieved. This provides a step towards integrating interactive 3-D topology optimization procedures into CAD software and mobile applications.

In mode acceleration method for topology optimization related harmonic response with multiple frequencies, most of the computation effort is invested in the solution of the eigen-problem. This paper is focused on reduction of the computational effort in repeated solution of the eigen-problem involved in mode acceleration method. The block combined approximation with shifting method is adopted for eigen-problem reanalysis, which simultaneously calculates some eigenpairs of modified structures. The triangular factorizations of shifted stiffness matrices generated within a certain number of design iterations are utilized to calculate the modes. For improving computational efficiency, Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) are utilized. The reanalysis method is based on matrix-matrix operations with Level-3 BLAS and can provide very fast development of approximate solutions of high quality for frequencies and associated mode shapes of the modified structure. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed topology optimization procedure and the accuracy of the approximate solutions.},

abstract = {Topology optimization under uncertainty of large-scale continuum structures is a computational challenge due to the combination of large finite element models and uncertainty propagation methods. The former aims to address the ever-increasing complexity of more and more realistic models, whereas the latter is required to estimate the statistical metrics of the formulation. In this work, the computational burden of the problem is addressed using a sparse grid stochastic collocation method, to calculate the statistical metrics of the topology optimization under uncertainty formulation, and a parallel adaptive mesh refinement method, to efficiently solve each of the stochastic collocation nodes. A two-level parallel processing scheme (TOUU-PS2) is proposed to profit from parallel computation on distributed memory systems: the stochastic nodes are distributed through the distributed memory system, and the efficient computation of each stochastic node is performed partitioning the problem using a domain decomposition strategy and solving each subdomain using an adaptive mesh refinement method. A dynamic load-balancing strategy is used to balance the workload between subdomains, and thus increasing the parallel performance by reducing processor idle time. The topology optimization problem is addressed using the topological derivative concept in combination with a level-set method. The performance and scalability of the proposed methodology are evaluated using several numerical benchmarks and real-world applications, showing good performance and scalability up to thousands of processors.},

abstract = {We present an improved method for topology optimization with both adaptive mesh refinement and derefinement. Since the total volume fraction in topology optimization is usually modest, after a few initial iterations the domain of computation is largely void. Hence, it is inefficient to have many small elements, in such regions, that contribute significantly to the overall computational cost but contribute little to the accuracy of computation and design. At the same time, we want high spatial resolution for accurate three-dimensional designs to avoid postprocessing or interpretation as much as possible. Dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) offers the possibility to balance these two requirements. We discuss requirements on AMR for topology optimization and the algorithmic features to implement them. The numerical design problems demonstrate (1) that our AMR strategy for topology optimization leads to designs that are equivalent to optimal designs on uniform meshes, (2) how AMR strategies that do not satisfy the postulated requirements may lead to suboptimal designs, and (3) that our AMR strategy significantly reduces the time to compute optimal designs.},

@article{Hoshina2018,
abstract = {The objective of topology optimization is to find the most efficient distribution of material (optimal topology) in a given domain, subjected to design constraints defined by the user. The quality of the new boundary representation depends on the level of mesh refinement: The greater the number of elements in the mesh, the better is the representation of the optimized structure. However, the use of refined meshes implies a high computational cost, particularly with regard to the numerical solution of the linear systems of equations that arise from the finite element method. This paper proposes a new computational strategy for adaptive local mesh refinement using polygonal finite elements in arbitrary two-dimensional domains. The idea is to perform a mesh refinement in regions of material concentration, mostly in inner and outer boundaries, and a mesh derefinement in regions of low material concentration, such as in internal holes. Thus, it is possible to obtain high-resolution optimal topologies with a relatively low computational cost. Representative examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methodology by comparing the results obtained here with results from the literature where refined meshes are kept constant throughout the topology optimization process.},

@article{Maute1995,
abstract = {Topology optimization of continuum structures is often reduced to a material distribution problem. Up to now this optimization problem has been solved following a rigid scheme. A design space is parametrized by design patches, which are fixed during the optimization process and are identical to the finite element discretization. The structural layout is determined, whether or not there is material in the design patches. Since many design patches are necessary to describe approximately the structural layout, this procedure leads to a large number of optimization variables. Furthermore, due to a lack of clearness and smoothness, the results obtained can often only be used as a conceptual design idea. To overcome these shortcomings adaptive techniques, which decrease the number of optimization variables and generate smooth results, are introduced. First, the use of pure mesh refinement in topology optimization is discussed. Since this technique still leads to unsatisfactory results, a new method is proposed that adapts the effective design space of each design cycle to the present material distribution. Since the effective design space is approximated by cubic or B{\'{e}}zier splines, this procedure does not only decrease the number of design variables and lead to smooth results, but can be directly joined to conventional shape optimization. With examples for maximum stiffness problems of elastic structures the quality of the proposed techniques is demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature Topology optimization of continuum structures is a challenging problem to solve, when stress constraints are considered for every finite element in the mesh. Difficulties are compounding in the reliability-based formulation, since a probabilistic problem needs to be solved for each stress constraint. This paper proposes a methodology to solve reliability-based topology optimization problems of continuum domains with stress constraints and uncertainties in magnitude of applied loads considering the whole set of local stress constrains, without using aggregation techniques. Probabilistic constraints are handled via a first-order approach, where the principle of superposition is used to alleviate the computational burden associated with inner optimization problems. Augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the outer problem, where all stress constraints are included in the augmented Lagrangian function; hence sensitivity analysis may be performed only for the augmented Lagrangian function, instead of for each stress constraint. Two example problems are addressed, for which crisp black and white topologies are obtained. The proposed methodology is shown to be accurate by checking reliability indices of final topologies with Monte Carlo Simulation.},

abstract = {{\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. This paper proposes an efficient gradient-based optimization approach for reliability-based topology optimization of structures under uncertainties. Our objective is to find the optimized topology of structures with minimum weight which also satisfy certain reliability requirements. In the literature, those problems are primarily performed with approaches that use a first-order reliability method (FORM) to estimate the gradient of the probability of failure. However, these approaches may lead to deficient or even invalid results because the gradient of probabilistic constraints, calculated by first order approximation, might not be sufficiently accurate. To overcome this issue, a newly developed segmental multi-point linearization (SML) method is employed in the optimization approach for a more accurate estimation of the gradient of failure probability. Meanwhile, this implementation also improves the approximation of the probability evaluation at no extra cost. In general, adoption of the SML method leads to a more accurate and robust approach. Numerical examples show that the new approach, based on the SML method, is numerically stable and usually provides optimized structures that have more of the desired features than conventional FORM-based approaches. The present approach typically does not lead to a fully stressed design, and thus this feature will be verified by numerical examples.},

abstract = {A robust shape and topology optimization (RSTO) approach with consideration of random field uncertainty in loading and material properties is developed in this work. The proposed approach integrates the state-of-the-art level set methods for shape and topology optimization and the latest research development in design under uncertainty. To characterize the high-dimensional random-field uncertainty with a reduced set of random variables, the Karhunen-Loeve expansion is employed. The univariate dimension-reduction (UDR) method combined with Gauss-type quadrature sampling is then employed for calculating statistical moments of the design response. The combination of the above techniques greatly reduces the computational cost in evaluating the statistical moments and enables a semi-analytical approach that evaluates the shape sensitivity of the statistical moments using shape sensitivity at each quadrature node. The applications of our approach to structure and compliant mechanism designs show that the proposed RSTO method can lead to designs with completely different topologies and superior robustness. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the applications of stochastic spectral methods for structural topology optimization in the presence of uncertainties. A non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion is integrated into a topology optimization algorithm to calculate low-order statistical moments of the mechanical–mathematical model response. This procedure, known as robust topology optimization, can optimize the mean of the compliance while simultaneously minimizing its standard deviation. In order to address possible variabilities in the loads applied to the mechanical system of interest, magnitude and direction of the external forces are assumed to be uncertain. In this probabilistic framework, forces are described as a random field or a set of random variables. Representation of the random objects and propagation of load uncertainties through the model are efficiently done through Karhunen–Lo{\`{e}}ve and polynomial chaos expansions. We take advantage of using polygonal elements, which have been shown to be effective in suppressing checkerboard patterns and reducing mesh dependency in the solution of topology optimization problems. Accuracy and applicability of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by means of several topology optimization examples. The obtained results, which are in excellent agreement with reference solutions computed via Monte Carlo method, show that load uncertainties play an important role in optimal design of structural systems, so that they must be taken into account to ensure a reliable optimization process.},

The paper concerns worst-case compliance optimization by finding the structural topology with minimum compliance for the loading due to the worst possible acceleration of the structure and attached non-structural masses. A main novelty of the paper is that it is shown how this min-max problem can be formulated as a non-linear semi-definite programming (SDP) problem involving a small-size constraint matrix and how this problem is solved numerically. Our SDP formulation is an extension of an eigenvalue problem seen previously in the literature; however, multiple eigenvalues naturally arise which makes the eigenvalue problem non-smooth, whereas the SDP problem presented in this paper provides a computationally tractable problem. Optimized designs, where the uncertain loading is due to acceleration of applied masses and the weight of the structure itself, are shown in two and three dimensions and we show that these designs satisfy optimality conditions that are also presented.},

abstract = {Many real-world engineering design problems are naturally cast in the form of optimization programs with uncertainty-contaminated data. In this context, a reliable design must be able to cope in some way with the presence of uncertainty. In this paper, we consider two standard philosophies for finding optimal solutions for uncertain convex optimization problems. In the first approach, classical in the stochastic optimization literature, the optimal design should minimize the expected value of the objective function with respect to uncertainty (average approach), while in the second one it should minimize the worst-case objective (worst-case or min-max approach). Both approaches are briefly reviewed in this paper and are shown to lead to exact and numerically efficient solution schemes when the uncertainty enters the data in simple form. For general uncertainty dependence however, the problems are numerically hard. In this paper, we present two techniques based on uncertainty randomization that permit to solve efficiently some suitable probabilistic relaxation of the indicated problems, with full generality with respect to the way in which the uncertainty enters the problem data. In the specific context of truss topology design, uncertainty in the problem arises, for instance, from imprecise knowledge of material characteristics and/or loading configurations. In this paper, we show how reliable structural design can be obtained using the proposed techniques based on the interplay of convex optimization and randomization. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Thore2015,
abstract = {1. Abstract Structures designed by topology optimization (TO) are frequently sensitive to loads different from the ones ac-counted for in the optimization. In extreme cases this means that loads differing ever so slightly from the ones it was designed to carry may cause a structure to collapse. It is therefore clear that handling uncertainty regarding the actual loadings is important. To address this issue in a systematic manner is one of the main goals in the field of robust TO. In this work we present a deterministic robust formulation of TO for maximum stiffness design which accounts for uncertain variations around a set of nominal loads. The idea is to find a design which minimizes the maximum compliance obtained as the loads vary in infinite, so-called uncertainty sets. This naturally gives rise to a semi-infinite optimization problem, which we here reformulate into a non-linear, semi-definite program. With appropriate numerical algorithms this optimization problem can be solved at a cost similar to that of solving a standard multiple load-case TO problem with the number of loads equal to the number of spatial dimensions plus one, times the number of nominal loads. In contrast to most previously suggested methods, which can only be applied to small-scale problems, the presented method is – as illustrated by a numerical example – well-suited for large-scale TO problems. 2. Keywords: Robust optimization, Topology optimization, Large-scale optimization, Non-linear semi-definite programming 3. Introduction Robust problem formulations in structural optimization can be divided into two groups [3]: (i) stochastic and (ii) deterministic, or worst-case. The stochastic approach is perhaps the most common. It can essentially be divided into two classes: reliability-based methods [15], often based on an inner loop where the structure is optimized and an outer loop where the uncertainty parameters are modified, and " sampling-based " methods, where the stochastic problem is converted into a deterministic by sampling from a probability distribution [10]. A drawback of stochas-tic methods is their reliance on good statistical data, and, in certain applications more importantly [3], they only provide probabilistic guarantees of robustness. In this paper we consider robust deterministic topology optimization of discretized continuum bodies governed by a linear equilibrium equation of the form Ku = f 0 + f var},

abstract = {Uncertainty is an important consideration in topology optimization to produce robust and reliable solutions. There are several possibilities to take into account the uncertainty in the topology optimization of continuum structures. In this paper, we assume that the only source of uncertainty is the variability of the applied load directions. Most models in this area apply parametric statistical tools to describe the directional uncertainty of the applied loads to produce robust structures which are insensitive to the directional uncertainty as much as possible. In the most popular parametric statistical approach the expected-compliance, based on the directional normality assumption, is used as the preferred measure of robustness. We will proof indirectly that this approach is far from the engineering practice and may give hardly interpretable or totally misleading results, which will be demonstrated by two carefully selected counter-examples. The counter-examples validate the fact that the expected-compliance, as a statistical abstraction based on more or less theoretical assumption about normality, not a general applicable measure of robustness. It will be shown, that the non-parametric and really robust volume-constrained worst-load-direction-oriented minimax-compliance model, used in this paper only as a proofing tool in a very simple form, is a viable alternative of the parametric expected-compliance model and its results and its problem solving process as a whole are very close to the engineering thinking. The worst-load-direction-oriented minimax-compliance-model provides expressive, rigorous, generally applicable, and objective information about the robustness. The parametric expected-compliance in itself as the preferred measure of robustness is unable to characterize the compliance variability, in contrast of the minimax approach which can be describe the compliance variability by a robust range-like measure computed very easily as the difference of the maximal- and minimal-compliance on the set of the feasible loading directions.},

abstract = {This work proposes a level-set based approach for solving risk-averse structural topology optimization problems considering random field loading and material uncertainty. The use of random fields increases the dimensionality of the stochastic domain, which poses several computational challenges related to the minimization of the Excess Probability as a measure of risk awareness. This problem is addressed both from the theoretical and numerical viewpoints. First, an existence result under a typical geometrical constraint on the set of admissible shapes is proved. Second, a level-set continuous approach to find the numerical solution of the problem is proposed. Since the considered cost functional has a discontinuous integrand, the numerical approximation of the functional and its sensitivity combine an adaptive anisotropic Polynomial Chaos (PC) approach with a Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling method for uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, to address the increment of dimensionality induced by the random field, an anisotropic sparse grid stochastic collocation method is used for the efficient computation of the PC coefficients. A key point is that the non-intrusive nature of such an approach facilitates the use of High Performance Computing (HPC) to alleviate the computational burden of the problem. Several numerical experiments including random field loading and material uncertainty are presented to show the feasibility of the proposal.},

Due to the inevitable phenomena that multi-source uncertainty factors in compliant mechanisms, which generally originate from material dispersion and uncertain external forces, severely affect the output motion accuracy, the robustness assessment and optimization with high confidence and efficiency is of great significance for scientists and engineers. In view of this, this study develops a novel approach of robust topology synthesis for compliant mechanisms with desired motion output by minimizing the expectation of Taguchi quantity loss function. The sensitivities of the robustness index with respect to design variables are calculated by the method of adjoint vector. Furthermore, the solution procedures of motion error based robust topology synthesis for geometrically linear and non-linear compliant mechanisms are elaborated. Two engineering examples are eventually presented to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the developed methodology.},

@article{Luo2009,
abstract = {Using a quantified measure for non-probab ilistic reliability based on the multi-ellipsoid convex model, the topology optimization of continuum structures in presence of uncertain-but-bounded parameters is investigated. The problem is formulated as a double-loop optimization one. The inner loop handles evaluation of the non-probabilistic reliability index, and the outer loop treats the optimum material distribution using the results from the inner loop for checking feasibility of the reliability constraints. For circumventing the numerical difficulties arising from its nested nature, the topology optimization problem with reliability constraints is reformulated into an equivalent one with constraints on the concerned performance. In this context, the adjoint variable schemes for sensitivity analysis with respect to uncertain variables as well as design variables are discussed. The structural optimization problem is then solved by a gradient-based algorithm using the obtained sensitivity. In the present formulation, the uncertain-but bounded uncertain variations of material properties, geometrical dimensions and loading conditions can be realistically accounted for. Numerical investigations illustrate the applicability and the validity of the present problem statement as well as the proposed numerical techniques.

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of recent investigations in the field of reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO). RBTO extends the reliability notion to the area of structural topology optimization. Although reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is a well established research area, very few works have been presented in the area of RBTO. Ever since Bends{\o}e and Kikuchi introduced the topology optimization method using a homogenization approach, many topology optimization methods have been developed for both linear and nonlinear structures. Traditional topology optimization methods drive topology of a structure to an optimum design based on a constraint on mass. Kharmanda et al introduced reliability constraints in deterministic topology optimization problem. They proposed a heuristic strategy that aims to reduce mass while improving the reliability level of the structure without greatly increasing its weight But the limit state function used by Kharmanda et al was not based on actual failure criteria for the structure. Their formulation considered uncertainty with respect to the geometrical dimensions and applied loads only. Patel et al. implemented an RBTO framework using the gradient free Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA) method. The Patel et al. formulation incorporates uncertainty with respect to material properties and applied loads. Patel et al. considered a limit state function based on the failure mode of the output displacement. This paper provides a comparative study of these methods. Advantages and disadvantages of the methods are discussed, and their significance in the field of RBTO is investigated. As large numbers of design variables are associated with continuum topology optimization problems, RBTO methods are inherently computationally expensive because of additional system analysis required when using RBDO methods.

abstract = {Topology optimization of mechanical structures often leads to efficient designs which resemble statically determinate structures. These economical structures are especially vulnerable to local loss of stiffness due to material failure. This paper therefore addresses local failure of continuum structures in topology optimization in order to design fail-safe structures which remain operable in a damaged state. A simplified model for local failure in continuum structures is adopted in the robust approach. The complex phenomenon of local failure is modeled by removal of material stiffness in patches with a fixed shape. The damage scenarios are taken into account by means of a minimax formulation of the optimization problem which minimizes the worst case performance. The detrimental influence of local failure on the nominal design is demonstrated in two representative examples: a cantilever beam optimized for minimum compliance and a compliant mechanism. The robust approach is applied successfully in the design of fail-safe alternatives for the structures in these examples. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Fail-safe robustness of critical load carrying structures is an important design philosophy for aerospace industry. The basic idea is that a structure should be designed to survive normal loading conditions when partial damage occurred. Such damage is quantified as complete failure of a structural member, or a partial damage of a larger structural part. In the context of topology optimization fail-safe consideration was first proposed by Jansen et al. Struct Multidiscip Optim 49(4):657{\&}ndash;666, (2014). While their approach captures the essence of fail-safe requirement, it has two major shortcomings: (1) it involves analysis of a very large number of FEA models at the scale equal to the number of elements; (2) failure was introduced in generic terms and therefore the fundamental aspects of failure test of discrete members was not discussed. This paper aims at establishing a rigorous framework for fail-safe topology optimization of general 3D structures, with the goal to develop a computationally viable solution for industrial applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several examples including a 3D example with over three hundred thousand elements. {\&}copy; 2016, The Author(s).},

This paper presents an approach to solving truss topology optimization problem with small uncertainty in the locations of the structural nodes. The nodal locations in the truss are assumed to be random, and the probabilistic method is used here to deal with the uncertainty. The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the mean compliance of the truss structure under nodal location uncertainty. It is a well-acknowledged barrier to compute the inverse of the structural stiffness matrix which involves variations in the optimization problem. In this paper, based on Neumann series expansion, this optimization problem can be recast into a simpler deterministic structural optimization problem. In order to avoid the sensitivity calculations for the objective function, the proportional topology optimization method which shows comparable eﬃciency and accuracy with gradient-based method is used. The numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and high eﬃciency of the proposed approach, and further illustrate that the optimal truss topology can be dramatically impacted by nodal location uncertainties.},

System reliability is based on a recently developed computational approach that is efficient and could be integrated within the framework of an evolutionary optimization process. The presence of multiple allowable topologies in the optimization process was handled through co-evolution in competing subpopulations. A unique feature of the algorithm is an automatic reunification of these populations using hypervolume measure-based indicator as reunification criterion to attain greater search efficiency.

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic approach for topology optimization under uncertainty that integrates non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion with design sensitivity analysis for reliability-based and robust topology optimization. Uncertainty is introduced in loading and in geometry to address the manufacturing variability. The manufacturing variability is modeled via a thresholding technique in which the threshold field is represented by a reduced dimensional random field. Response metrics such as compliance and volume are characterized as polynomial chaos expansions of the underlying uncertain parameters thus allowing accurate and efficient estimation of statistical moments, failure probabilities and their sensitivities. The number of simulations is reduced for linear structures under loading uncertainty by means of superposition. Efficiency of the non-intrusive polynomial chaos approach is highlighted by comparison with the Monte Carlo method in terms of the number of simulations. To demonstrate the effect of uncertainty, optimized designs that consider uncertainty are compared to those that do not. Comparisons of polynomial chaos expansion to existing analytical methods on a benchmark numerical example are also provided for reliability-based and worst case designs.},

abstract = {Topology optimization using stress constraints and considering uncertainties is a serious challenge, since a reliability problem has to be solved for each stress constraint, for each element in the mesh. In this paper, an alternative way of solving this problem is employed, where uncertainty quantification is performed through the first order perturbation approach, with proper validation by Monte Carlo Simulation. Uncertainties are considered in the loading magnitude and direction. The minimum volume problem subjected to local stress constraints is formulated as a robust problem, where the stress constraints are written as a weighted average between their expected value and standard deviation. The augmented Lagrangian method is used for handling the large set of local stress constraints, whereas a gradient based algorithm is used for handling the bounding constraints. It is shown that even in the presence of small uncertainties in loading direction, different topologies are obtained when compared to a deterministic approach. The effect of correlation between uncertainties in loading magnitude and direction on optimal topologies is also studied, where the main observed result is loss of symmetry in optimal topologies.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) makes it possible to fabricate complicated parts that are otherwise difficult to manufacture by subtractive machining. However, such parts often require temporary support material to prevent the component from collapsing or warping during fabrication. The support material results in increased material consumption, manufacturing time, and clean-up costs. The surface precision and dimensional accuracy of the workpieces from AM are far from the engineering requirement due to layer upon layer manufacturing. Subtractive machining (SM), by contrast, can fabricate parts to satisfy the requirements of surface precision and dimensional accuracy. Nevertheless, the components need to be relatively uncomplicated for subtractive manufacturing. Thus, hybrid additive-subtractive manufacturing (HASM) is gaining increasing attention in order to take advantages of both processes. There is little research on the topological design methodology for this hybrid manufacturing technology. To address thisissue,a methodbased ongeometryapproach for topology optimizationofcontinuum structure isproposedinthis paper. Both additive manufacturing and subtractive machining constraints are simultaneously considered in each topology optimization iteration. The topology optimization is performed by the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method.

However, many realistic structures do not have such concrete supports. In a robust optimization, i.e., optimization for uncertain load inputs, it is desirable to involve support uncertainty. However, such a robust optimization has not been available since constrained nodes are required to convert the stiffness matrix to an invertible matrix. This paper demonstrates a quite simple robust optimization based on a pseudo-inverse stiffness matrix and eigenvalue analysis that successfully creates optimal design without constrained nodes. The optimization strategy is to minimize the largest eigenvalue of the pseudo-inverse matrix. It was found that optimization for multiple eigenvalues, i.e., multiple load inputs, is required as the nature of the minimax problem. The created structures are capable of carrying multiple load inputs—bending, torsion, and more complex loads.

For efficient evaluations of first-passage probability during the optimization, the failure event is described as a series system event consisting of instantaneous failure events defined at discrete time points. The probability of the series system event is then computed by use of a system reliability analysis method termed as the sequential compounding method. The adjoint sensitivity formulation is derived for calculating the parameter sensitivity of the first-passage probability to facilitate the use of efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated by numerical examples of a space truss and building structures subjected to stochastic earthquake ground motions.},

abstract = {Probabilistic topology optimization has gained significant research attention recently. This interest stems from the realization that the achieved high-performance designs resulted from deterministic topology optimization algorithms may become suboptimal under real-world conditions that are often accompanied with uncertainties. Among sources of these uncertainties, the ones that define structural characteristics, such as geometry, are numerically challenging to treat as they lead to stochastic structural stiffness. To date, research on developing efficient probabilistic topology optimization under stochastic stiffness is mainly focused on displacement-based objectives. However, in the design of structures, stress is also a primary design criterion that needs to be directly controlled for. A robust stress-based topology optimization methodology for frame structures under geometric uncertainty is proposed in this work. Assuming that such uncertainties are small relative to frame member lengths, the proposed methodology uses stochastic perturbation method to propagate these uncertainties up to the response level, which is expressed by the maximum of expected values of von Mises stresses throughout the domain. Sensitivities of the response with respect to design variables are derived analytically, which allows using efficient gradient-based optimizers. The proposed algorithm is examined with stress-based design of three frame structures under geometric uncertainty. Changes in the topology of these new designs are discussed, and they are shown to outperform deterministic designs when subjected to geometric uncertainties. Moreover, predictions and the resulting designs from the proposed methodology are found to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results.},

The objective is the minimization of the amount of material used in the design, subjected to local stress constraints under uncertainties. The probability of failure is bounded by the one-sided Chebychev inequality, since the exact probability distribution function of the stress constraints is not known in advance.

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a stochastic model for topology optimization. We find robust structures that minimize the compliance for a given main load having a stochastic behavior. We propose a model that takes into account the expected value of the compliance and its variance. We show that, similarly to the case of truss structures, these values can be computed with an equivalent deterministic approach and the stochastic model can be transformed into a nonlinear programming problem, reducing the complexity of this kind of problems. First, we obtain an explicit expression (at the continuous level) of the expected compliance and its variance, then we consider a numerical discretization (by using a finite element method) of this expression and finally we use an optimization algorithm. This approach allows to solve design problems which include point, surface or volume loads with dependent or independent perturbations. We check the capacity of our formulation to generate structures that are robust to main loads and their perturbations by considering several 2D and 3D numerical examples. To this end, we analyze the behavior of our model by studying the impact on the optimized solutions of the expected-compliance and variance weight coefficients, the laws used to describe the random loads, the variance of the perturbations and the dependence/independence of the perturbations.

The setting is the optimal design of a linear-elastic structure, for example a truss topology, under unilateral frictionless contact, and under uncertainty in the data describing the load conditions, the material properties, and the rigid foundation. The resulting stochastic bilevel optimization model finds a structural design that responds the best to the given probability distribution in the data. This model is of special interest when a structural failure will lead to a reconstruction cost, rather than loss of life. For the mathematical model, we provide results on the existence of optimal solutions which allow for zero lower design bounds. We establish that the optimal solution is continuous in the lower design bounds, a result which validates the use of small but positive values of them, and for such bounds we also establish the locally Lipschitz continuity and directional differe ntiability of the implicit upper-level objective function. We also provide a heuristic algorithm for the solution of the problem, which makes use of its differentiability properties and parallelization strategies across the scenarios. A small set of numerical experiments illustrates the behaviour of the stochastic solution compared to an average-case deterministic one, establishing an increased robustness.},

This study investigates the robust topology optimization of a thin plate structure under a concentrated load with load position uncertainty. The effect of uncertain load direction, load magnitude, and load distribution in topology optimization problems has been investigated in previous research, but few studies have dealt with robust topology optimization considering load position uncertainty. In this study, load position uncertainty is modeled using the convex hull model, in which the load position uncertainty is confined within a circular area whose center is at the nominal load position. The worst load condition is defined as that when the applied load is at a position in the convex hull that gives the worst value of the mean compliance. Here, the robust objective function is formulated as a weighted sum of the mean compliance obtained from the mean load condition and the worst compliance obtained from the worst load condition, with a plate model based on Reissner-Mindlin plate theory. The robust topology optimization problem is formulated using a level set-based topology optimization method. Through numerical examples, robust optimum configurations are compared with deterministic optimum configurations and the validity of the proposed robust design method is then discussed.},

abstract = {Topology optimization often leads to structures consisting of slender elements which are particularly sensitive to geometric imperfections. Such imperfections might affect the structural stability and induce large displacement effects in these slender structures. This paper therefore presents a robust approach to topology optimization which accounts for geometric imperfections and their potentially detrimental influence on the structural stability. Geometric nonlinear effects are incorporated in the optimization by means of a Total Lagrangian finite element formulation in the minimization of end-compliance. Geometric imperfections are modeled as a vector-valued random field in the design domain. The resulting uncertain performance of the design is taken into account by minimizing a weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation of the compliance in the robust optimization problem. These stochastic moments are typically estimated by means of sampling methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. However, these methods require multiple independent nonlinear finite element analyses in each design iteration of the optimization algorithm. An efficient solution algorithm which uses adjoint differentiation in a second-order perturbation method is therefore developed to estimate the stochastic moments during the optimization. Two applications with structures that exhibit different types of structural instabilities are examined. In both cases, it is demonstrated by means of an extensive Monte Carlo simulation that the deterministic design is very sensitive to imperfections, while the design obtained by means of the proposed method is much more robust.},

In order for the topology optimization results to be validated, statistical investigations are performed to estimate probabilities of failure that fluctuating peak responses of such optimized designs exceed certain specified amounts. The computational results confirm that topological material distributions of optimized solids or structures with maximum peak response serviceability highly depend on temporal correlation degrees of uncertain stationary load sequences of long-term processes. Furthermore, conventional topology optimization of solid continua subjected to deterministic loads is also compared with the aforementioned optimized material distributions regarding uncertain loads. As a consequence, an effective computation framework for solving robust topology optimization problems under loading uncertainty can be established based on the proposed methodology.

abstract = {1. Abstract Structural topology optimization often leads to slender structures which are sensitive to geometric im-perfections such as the misplacement of material. A robust approach is therefore presented in order to take into account material misplacement in topology optimization problems. A probabilistic approach to robust optimization is followed. Spatially varying geometric imperfections are modeled by means of a vector-valued Gaussian random field. Both a linear elastic and a nonlinear elastic formulation are con-sidered in order to analyze the importance of geometric nonlinear effects on the design performance and the optimized design. The objective function of the robust optimization problem is defined as a weighted sum of the mean value and the standard deviation of the performance of the structure under uncertainty. A sampling method is used to estimate these statistics and the sensitivities thereof in the optimization algorithm. The solutions obtained by the robust approach are verified by means of an extensive Monte Carlo simulation. 2. Keywords: Topology optimization, robust design optimization, geometric imperfections, random fields 3. Introduction Structural design optimization is an essential part of engineering in order to realize highly performing designs at a low cost. Topology optimization is a powerful tool in this respect as it simultaneously optimizes the size, shape and topology of a design, often resulting in new and original designs. This has led to its widespread deployment in various fields of applications. The designs obtained by a classical deterministic optimization however are often only optimal for a single set of input data and variations in the system can drastically decrease the performance of the design or even make it infeasible. A structure is subjected to multiple sources of uncertainty: loads, material properties, manufacturing errors, environmental conditions, etc. In robust optimization [2, 5], these uncertainties are taken into account in the optimization in order to find well-performing designs which are also insensitive with respect to variations in the system. This paper focuses on geometric imperfections as a source of uncertainty in the design of mechanical structures. In particular, we consider uncertainty in the actual location of structural elements which can deviate from the ideal nominal design. Material misplacement is encountered in civil engineering applications and originates, for example, from errors during the manufacturing process. Designs consisting of axially loaded slender elements are particularly sensitive to material misplacement due to their small stiffness for the additional bending moments which occur when the element is distorted. Moreover, the vulnerability of compressed slender members to geometric imperfections becomes especially apparent when nonlinear phenomena such as P − ∆ effects and buckling are considered. A nonlinear elastic formulation is therefore adopted in this study in order to account for the geometric nonlinear behavior of the design. A robust approach is presented which incorporates geometric imperfections due to misplacement of ma-terial into continuum topology optimization. Several paradigms to robust optimization exist in the literature [5]. This study adopts a probabilistic approach: probability distributions are attributed to the uncertainties and probabilistic moments are used to assess the robust performance of a design. The paper starts with a brief description of topology optimization of deterministic mechanical struc-tures. Afterwards, geometric imperfections are discussed and a random field model for spatially varying 1},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature A topology optimization framework is proposed for robust design of skeletal structures with stochastically imperfect structural members. Imperfections are modeled as uncertain members' out-of-straightness using curved frame elements in the form of predefined functions with random magnitudes throughout the structure. The stochastic perturbation method is used for propagating the imperfection uncertainty up to the structural response level, and the expected value of performance measure or constraint is used to form the stochastic topology optimization problem. Sensitivities are derived explicitly using the adjoint method and are used in conjunction with an efficient gradient-based optimizer in search for robust optimal topologies. Topological designs for three representative examples are investigated with the proposed algorithm and the resulting topologies are compared with the deterministic designs. It is observed that the new designs primarily feature load path diversification, which is pronounced with increasing level of uncertainty, and occasionally member thickening to mitigate the impact of the uncertainty in members' out-of-straightness on structural performance.},

Structural optimization taking uncertainties into account is of significant importance to designers, since real-world structures require both efficient use of material and accurate modelling of material properties, manufacturing tolerances and loading of structures. When considering candidate designs, engineers are concerned with the sensitivity of the designs to small variations which can be quantified as uncertainties. Robust design optimization offers a framework for taking these uncertainties into account. While some work has very recently been done on robust shape and topology optimization of two dimensional structures [2] for mass minimization, 3D structures appear to have not been dealt with broadly [3], and, to the authors' knowledge, no common frameworks exist for robust optimization of both continuum and truss structures. The representation of uncertainties in robust optimization of truss structures has also been relatively neglected and investigations thus far have failed to take some key features of trusses, such as element length, into account.},

@article{Jansen2013a,
abstract = {The use of topology optimization for structural design often leads to slender structures. Slender structures are sensitive to geometric imperfections such as the misplacement or misalignment of material. The present paper therefore proposes a robust approach to topology optimization taking into account this type of geometric imperfections. A density filter based approach is followed, and translations of material are obtained by adding a small perturbation to the center of the filter kernel. The spatial variation of the geometric imperfections is modeled by means of a vector valued random field. The random field is conditioned in order to incorporate supports in the design where no misplacement of material occurs. In the robust optimization problem, the objective function is defined as a weighted sum of the mean value and the standard deviation of the performance of the structure under uncertainty. A sampling method is used to estimate these statistics during the optimization process. The proposed method is successfully applied to three example problems: the minimum compliance design of a slender column-like structure and a cantilever beam and a compliant mechanism design. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation is used to show that the obtained topologies are more robust with respect to geometric imperfections. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

A two-level optimization formulation is often used in the Robust Topology Optimization (RTO) under uncertain loads. Various approaches have been reported to identify the critical loads associated with the worst structure responses. Because Convex Model approaches apply convex approximations to the original non-convex model at the lower level, the optimal designs obtained by these methods are greatly dependent on the quality of the approximation. In this paper, a new formulation based on the Wolfe duality for the RTO problems with multiple independent unknown-but-bounded loads is proposed. Following the two-level formulation, the lower level optimization problem for the worst multiple independent uncertain loading case is transformed by the Wolfe duality. Both the first order necessary conditions and the second order sufficient conditions are derived rigorously to validate the solution optimality despite of the non-convexity associated with the lower level formulation.

The objective of the design optimisation is to minimise the standard deviation of the weighted structural compliance. The gradient-based method is applied to perform a sensitivity analysis for the identification of optimal design variables. A material replacement method is used to overcome difficulty in the sensitivity analysis due to the stress-dependent behaviour of the original bi-modulus material. In the material replacement operation, two new isotropic materials are identified to replace the original bi-modulus material according to its two moduli. To reduce the side effects of the material replacement operation on the final design, the local stiffness is modified in terms of the stress state. Typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to the final design, including the load uncertainty on the optimal bi-modulus layout, as well as other factors, such as loading direction and the ratio between the two moduli of the bi-modulus material. The comparison between layouts of isotropic and bi-modulus materials also shows that the final bi-modulus material distribution is sensitive to loading directions in practical designs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the presented method. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The aim of this article is to introduce a new topology optimisation formulation for optimal robust design of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems. Mesh independence in topology optimisation is most often ensured by using filtering techniques, which result in transition grey regions difficult to interpret in practical realisations. This problem has been alleviated recently by projection techniques, but these destroy the mesh independence introduced by the filters and result in single node connected hinges. Such features in the design are undesirable as they are not robust with respect to geometric manufacturing errors (such as under/over etching). They can be avoided by optimising for several design realisations which take into account the possible geometry errors. The design variations are modelled with the help of random variables. The proposed stochastic formulation for the design variations results in nearly black and white mechanism designs, robust with respect to uncertainties in the production process, i.e. without any hinges or small details which can create manufacturing difficulties.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The considered sources of uncertainty are the applied load, the spatially varying Young's modulus, and the geometry with focus on the latter two. In difference to similar existing approaches for robust topology optimization, the presented approach requires only one solution of an adjoint system to determine the derivatives of the variance, which keeps the computation time close to the deterministic optimization. For validation, also the second-order fourth-moment method and Monte Carlo simulations are embedded into the optimization. For all approaches, the applicability and impact on the resulting design are demonstrated by application to benchmark examples. For random load, the first-order second-moment approach provides unsatisfying results. For random, Young's modulus and geometry, however, the robust topology optimization using first-order second-moment approach provides robust designs at very little computational cost.},

abstract = {A unified framework for robust and reliability-based structural topology optimization, considering structural model and loading uncertainties, is presented using a continuous adjoint formulation. The topology optimization is formulated for objective functions related to uncertainty measures of the compliance or displacements of the structure. Uncertainty measures, such as mean, standard deviation, and level exceedance probability or failure probability, involve the estimation of multidimensional integrals over the uncertain parameter space. These integrals are evaluated using (1) sparse grid quadrature techniques for the mean and standard deviation and (2) the approximate first-order reliability method (FORM) for failure probability. A unified continuous adjoint formulation is presented for the different objective function formulations. Simplifications are proposed that result in increased computational efficiency and accuracy for special cases of uncertainties and structural performance measures. The proposed formulation is demonstrated by computing the optimal distribution of material in a two-dimensional structure under loading and material uncertainties. For the approximate FORM-based topology optimization, computational difficulties are pointed out because of the existence of multiple design points in the uncertain parameter space.},

The scalar function is then regularized by a PDE based filter. Several image-processing based filtering techniques have so far been proposed for regularization or restricting the minimum length scale. They are conventionally applied to the design sensitivities rather than the design variables themselves. However, it causes discrepancies between the filtered sensitivities and the actual sensitivities that may confuse the optimization process and disturb the convergence. In this paper, we propose a Heaviside projection based topology optimization method with a scalar function that is filtered by a Helmholtz type partial differential equation. Therefore, the optimality can be strictly discussed in terms of the KKT condition. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a minimum compliance problem is solved. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The method combines the spectral stochastic approach for the representation and propagation of uncertainties with an existing deterministic topology optimization technique. The idea in spectral stochastic formulations is to add an extra dimension, a random dimension, to the problem where the stochastic variability of the input parameters (and outputs of interest) can be modeled. The resulting compact representations for the response quantities allow for efficient and accurate calculation of sensitivities of response statistics with respect to the design variables which are then fed into a gradient-based optimizer that searches for the optimum design. From a variety of frameworks for uncertainty-informed optimization, robust topology optimization is chosen to demonstrate the applicability of the method. Examples from continuum topology optimization under uncertainty in material properties are presented. It is also shown that results obtained from the proposed method are in excellent agreement with those obtained from a Monte Carlo-based optimization algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Basel AG. All rights reserved. This article is concerned with different approaches to elastic shape optimization under stochastic loading. The underlying stochastic optimization strategy builds upon the methodology of two-stage stochastic programming. In fact, in the case of linear elasticity and quadratic objective functionals our strategy leads to a computational cost which scales linearly in the number of linearly independent applied forces, even for a large set of realizations of the random loading. We consider, besides minimization of the expectation value of suitable objective functionals, also two different risk averse approaches, namely the expected excess and the excess probability. Numerical computations are performed using either a level set approach representing implicit shapes of general topology in combination with composite finite elements to resolve elasticity in two and  three dimensions, or a collocation boundary element approach, where polygonal shapes represent geometric details attached to a lattice and describing a perforated elastic domain. Topology optimization is performed using the concept of topological derivatives. We generalize this concept, and derive an analytical expression which takes into account the interaction between neighboring holes. This is expected to allow efficient and reliable optimization strategies of elastic objects with a large number of geometric details on a fine scale.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient probabilistic method to solve a fully deterministic problem — we present a randomized optimization approach that drastically reduces the enormous computational cost of optimizing designs under many load cases for both continuum and truss topology optimization. Practical structural designs by deterministic topology optimization typically involve many load cases, possibly hundreds or more. The optimal design minimizes a, possibly weighted, average of the compliance under each load case (or some other objective). This means that, in each optimization step, a large finite element problem must be solved for each load case, leading to an enormous computational effort. On the contrary, the proposed randomized optimization method with stochastic sampling requires the solution of only a few (e.g., 5 or 6) finite element problems (large linear systems) per optimization step. Based on simulated annealing, we introduce a damping scheme for the randomized approach. Through numerical examples in two and three dimensions, we demonstrate that the randomization algorithm drastically reduces computational cost to obtain similar final topologies and results (e.g., compliance) to those of standard algorithms. The results indicate that the damping scheme is effective and leads to rapid convergence of the proposed algorithm.},

We begin by considering the use of random test vectors and then explore special vectors obtained from Hadamard matrices. The methods are tested in the context of computational materials science to estimate the diagonal of the density matrix which holds the charge densities.

Integrating the spectral density over an interval gives the eigenvalue count of the matrix in that interval. Therefore the rank can be approximated by integrating the spectral density over a carefully selected interval. Two different approaches are discussed to estimate the approximate rank, one based on Chebyshev polynomials and the other based on the Lanczos algorithm. In order to obtain the appropriate interval, it is necessary to locate a gap between the eigenvalues that correspond to noise and the relevant eigenvalues that contribute to the matrix rank. A method for locating this gap and selecting the interval of integration is proposed based on the plot of the spectral density.

abstract = {We analyze the convergence of randomized trace estimators. Starting at 1989, several algorithms have been proposed for estimating the trace of a matrix by 1 M M i=1 z T i Azi, where the zi are random vectors, have been proposed; different estimators use different distributions for the zis, all of which lead to E(1 M M i=1 z T i Azi) = trace(A). These algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of A but rather an efficient method compute z T Az given z. Existing results only analyze the variance of the different estimators. In contrast, we analyze the number of samples M required to guarantee that with probability at least 1 − $\delta$, the relative error in the estimate is at most We argue that such bounds are much more useful in applications than the variance. We found that these bounds rank the estimators differently than the variance; this suggests that minimum-variance estimators may not be the best. We also make two additional contributions to this area. The first is a specialized bound for projection matrices, whose trace (rank) needs to be computed in electronic structure calculations. The second is a new estimator that uses less randomness than all the existing estimators.},

The method generalises an existing deterministic scheme, in which the structure is represented and evolved by a level-set method coupled with mathematical programming. The stochastic element of the algorithm is built on the methods of statistical mechanics and is designed so that the system explores a Boltzmann–Gibbs distribution of structures. In non-convex optimisation problems, the deterministic algorithm can get trapped in local optima: the stochastic generalisation enables sampling of multiple local optima, which aids the search for the globally-optimal structure. The method is demonstrated for several simple geometrical problems, and a proof-of-principle calculation is shown for a simple engineering structure.},

The fundamental principle behind its use requires a density design variable dependent material constitutive law that penalizes intermediate density material in combination with an active volume constraint. Here, the SIMP method with filtering is reevaluated, and an alternative topology optimization problem formulation, called the SINH (pronounced “cinch”) method, is developed that exploits this principle. The main advantages of the SINH method are that the optimization problem is consistently defined, the topology description is unambiguous, and the method leads to predominantly solid–void designs.},

Most of the problems reported in specialized literature present differences in specifications such as lengths, units, materials among others. For instance, some articles propose the same proportions and geometrical shapes but different dimensions. Hence, the purpose of this benchmark is to unify geometrical and mechanical characteristics and load conditions, considering that the proposed problems must be realistic, in the sense that the units are in the International System and a real-world material and load conditions are used. The final benchmark integrates 13 problems for plane stress using ASTM A-36 steel. Additionally, we report approximations to the optimum solutions for both: compliance and volume minimization problems using the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) and a novel version of SIMP proposed in this article.},

The performance profiles conclude that general solvers are as efficient and reliable as classical structural topology opti- mization solvers.Moreover, the use of the exact Hessians in SAND formulations, generally produce designs with better objective function values. However, with the benchmarked implementations solving SAND formulations consumes more computational time than solving the corresponding nested formulations.},

In this work a new penalization scheme for the SIMP-method (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) is presented. One advantage of the presented method is a linear density-stiffness relationship, which has advantages for self-weight or eigenfrequency problems. The optimization problem is solved through derived optimality criteria (OC), which is also introduced in this paper. The derived OC uses no sensitivities of the optimization function but is equivalent to the classical OC in the case of no penalization. In the case with penalization we present an objective function for the penalty factor. By maximizing the objective function in each iteration, we get an adaptive penalty factor. Numerical experiments show, that the adaptive penalty factor leads to better optimization results then a fixed penalty factor. The presented topology optimization method is implemented in the commercial FEM package ANSYS under the name TopoAD. One useful extension of TopoAD is the concept of "meta elements", which is also presented in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2009 German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

An automatic scheme for adjusting the penalization parameter is introduced to deal with this conflict and thus achieve better designs. Based on an investigation on the effect of the penalization parameter on design evolution during the optimization process, a rule is established to determine appropriate penalization parameter values. Using this rule, an effective scheme is developed for determining penalization parameter values such that buckling constraints are appropriately considered throughout the optimization process.

Finite element approximation and geometry representation benefit from such refinement by enabling more accurate stress field predictions and greater resolution of the optimal structural boundaries. We combine a volume fraction filter to impose a minimum design feature size, the RAMP penalization to generate “black-and-white designs” and a RAMP-like stress definition to resolve the “stress singularity problem.” Regions with stress concentrations dominate the optimized design. As such, rigorous simulations are required to accurately approximate the stress field. To achieve this goal, we invoke a threshold operation and mesh refinement during the optimization. We do so in an optimal fashion, by applying adaptive mesh refinement techniques that use error indicators to refine and coarsen the mesh as needed. In this way, we obtain more accurate simulations and greater resolution of the design domain. We present results in two dimensions to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.},

Following this approach, we first reformulate the original optimization problem with a design-dependent set of constraints into an equivalent optimization problem with a fixed design-independent set of constraints. The next step is to perform constraint aggregation over the reformulated local constraints using a lower bound aggregation function. We demonstrate that this approach concurrently aggregates the constraints and relaxes the feasible domain, thereby making singular optima accessible. The main advantage is that no separate constraint relaxation techniques are necessary, which reduces the parameter dependence of the problem. Furthermore, there is a clear relationship between the original feasible domain and the perturbed feasible domain via this aggregation parameter.},

A new method based on adaptive volume constraint and stress penalty is proposed. According to this method, the stress-constrained volume and compliance minimization topology optimization problem is transformed into two simple and related problems: a stress-penalty-based compliance minimization problem and a volume-decision problem. In the former problem, stress penalty is conducted and used to control the local stress level of the structure. To solve this problem, the parametric level set method with the compactly supported radial basis functions is adopted. Meanwhile, an adaptive adjusting scheme of the stress penalty factor is used to improve the control of the local stress level. To solve the volume-decision problem, a combination scheme of the interval search and local search is proposed. Numerical examples are used to test the proposed method. Results show the lightweight design, which meets the stress constraint and whose compliance is simultaneously optimized, can be obtained by the proposed method.},

                  {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}A new suite of computational procedures for stress-constrained continuum topology optimization is presented. In contrast to common approaches for imposing stress constraints, herein it is proposed to limit the maximum stress by controlling the length scale of the optimized design. Several procedures are formulated based on the treatment of the filter radius as a design variable. This enables to automatically manipulate the minimum length scale such that stresses are constrained to the allowable value, while the optimization is driven to minimizing compliance under a volume constraint – without any direct constraints on stresses. Numerical experiments are presented that incorporate the following : 1) Global control over the filter radius that leads to a uniform minimum length scale throughout the design; 2) Spatial variation of the filter radius that leads to local manipulation of the minimum length according to stress concentrations; and 3) Combinations of the two above. The optimized designs provide high-quality trade-offs between compliance, stress and volume. From a computational perspective, the proposed procedures are efficient and simple to implement: essentially, stress-constrained topology optimization is posed as a minimum compliance problem with additional treatment of the length scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Kennedy2016,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a full-space barrier method designed for stress-constrained mass minimization problems with discrete material options. The advantages of the full-space barrier method are twofold. First, in the full-space the stress constraints are provably concave, which facilitates the construction of convex subproblems within the optimization algorithm. Second, by using the full-space, it is no longer necessary to employ stress constraint aggregation techniques to reduce adjoint-gradient evaluation costs. The proposed optimization algorithm uses a Newton method where an approximate linearization of the KKT conditions is solved inexactly at each iteration using a preconditioned Krylov subspace method. Sparse constraints that arise in the discrete material parametrization are treated using a null-space method. Results of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated on a series of three topology and multimaterial optimization problems with selection between isotropic and orthotropic materials, as well as discrete ply-angle selection.},

@article{Cheng1992,
abstract = {The paper studies the relation between topology optimization and size optimization of truss structures. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the structural weight under stress constraints and side constraints on member cross sectional areas. The limiting stress concept is defined and the computational formula of limiting stress for truss structures calculated by a finite element method is given. Based on the limiting stress concept the continuity of the stress function at zero cross sectional area is carefully examined which enables us to understand the dilemma of defining the stress function in the closed interval up to zero cross sectional area. By considering the relation between the limiting stress and allowable stress the feasibility of stress constraints is discussed and the difficulty of adding a new bar to the truss or deleting an existing one is better understood. We have also shown that for topology optimization of truss structures the feasible design domain in the design space is a connected domain with possible degenerate subregions as long as upper bounds on cross sectional areas are large enough. To overcome this difficulty we introduce a quality function and replace the stress constraint by a new constraint which has the same feasibility and is continuous in the closed interval up to zero cross sectional area. In this way the formulations of structural topology optimization and size optimization are unified and an optimization algorithm which works only for problems with continuous constraint functions can be applied to optimize the topology of the truss structures. Simple examples are presented to show the possibility of automatically and rationally removing or adding b a n and hence treating topological optimization in the same way as sizing optimization. Finally, further possible research on these topics is addressed.},

abstract = {The present paper studies some aspects of formulations of truss topology optimization problems. The ground structure approach-based formulations of three types of truss topology optimization problems, namely the problems of minimum weight design for a given compliance, of minimum weight design with stress constraints and of minimum weight design with stress constraints and local buckling constraints are examined. The common difficulties with the formulations of the three problems are discussed. Since the continuity of the constraint or/and objective function is an important factor for the determination of the mathematical structure of optimization problems, the issue of the continuity of stress, displacement and compliance functions in terms of the cross-sectional areas at zero area is studied. It is shown that the bar stress function has discontinuity at zero cross-sectional area, and the structural displacement and compliance are continuous functions of the cross-sectional area. Based on the discontinuity of the stress function we point out the features of the feasible domain and global optimum for optimization problems with stress and/or local buckling constraints, and conclude that they are mathematical programming with discontinuous constraint functions and that they are essentially discrete optimization problems. The difference between topology optimization with global constraints such as structural compliance and that with local constraints on stress or/and local buckling is notable and has important consequences for the solution approach},

abstract = {This paper presents an efficient topology optimization strategy for seeking the optimal layout of continuum structures exhibiting asymmetrical strength behaviors in compression and tension. Based on the Drucker-Prager yield criterion and the power-law interpolation scheme for the material property, the optimization problem is formulated as to minimize the material volume under local stress constraints. The -relaxation of stress constraints is adopted to circumvent the stress singularity problem. For improving the computational efficiency, a grouped aggregation approach based on the Kreisselmeier- Steinhauser function is employed to reduce the number of constraints without much sacrificing the approximation accuracy of the stress constraints. In conjunction with the adjoint-variable sensitivity analysis, the minimization problem is solved by a gradient-based optimization algorithm. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity of the present optimization model as well as the efficiency of the proposed numerical techniques. Moreover, it is also revealed that the optimal design of a structure with pressure-dependent material may exhibit a considerable different topology from the one obtained with pressure-independent material model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract This paper develops and evaluates a method for handling stress constraints in topology optimiza-tion. The stress constraints are used together with an objective function that minimizes mass or maximizes stiffness, and in addition, the traditional stiffness based formulation is discussed for comparison. We use a clus-tering technique, where stresses for several stress evalu-ation points are clustered into groups using a modified P-norm to decrease the number of stress constraints and thus the computational cost. We give a detailed description of the formulations and the sensitivity anal-ysis. This is done in a general manner, so that different element types and 2D as well as 3D structures can be treated. However, we restrict the numerical examples to 2D structures with bilinear quadrilateral elements. The three formulations and different approaches to stress constraints are compared using two well known test examples in topology optimization: the L-shaped beam and the MBB-beam. In contrast to some other papers on stress constrained topology optimization, we find that our formulation gives topologies that are sig-nificantly different from traditionally optimized designs, in that it actually manage to avoid stress concentra-tions. It can therefore be used to generate conceptual designs for industrial applications.},

abstract = {Optim provides a range of optimization capabilities written in the Julia programming language (Bezanson et al. 2017). Our aim is to enable researchers, users, and other Julia packages to solve optimization problems without writing such algorithms themselves. The package supports optimization on manifolds, functions of complex numbers, and input types such as arbitrary precision vectors and matrices. We have implemented routines for derivative free, first-order, and second-order optimization methods. The user can provide derivatives themselves, or request that they are calculated using automatic differentiation or finite difference methods. The main focus of the package has currently been on unconstrained optimization, however, box-constrained optimization is supported, and a more comprehensive support for constraints is underway. Similar to Optim, the C library NLopt (Johnson 2008) contains a collection of nonlinear optimization routines. In Python, scipy.optimize supports many of the same algorithms as Optim does, and Pymanopt (Townsend, Niklas, and Weichwald 2016) is a toolbox for manifold optimization. Within the Julia community, the packages BlackBoxOptim.jl and Optimize.jl provide optimization capabilities focusing on derivative-free and large-scale smooth problems respectively. The packages Convex.jl and JuMP.jl (Dunning, Huchette, and Lubin 2017) define modelling languages for which users can formulate optimization problems. In contrast to the previously mentioned optimization codes, Convex and JuMP work as abstraction layers between the user and solvers from a other packages. Optimization routines As of version 0.14, the following optimization routines are available. • Second-order methods – Newton – Newton with trust region – Hessian-vector with trust region • First-order methods – BFGS – L-BFGS (with linear preconditioning) – Conjugate gradient (with linear preconditioning) – Gradient descent (with linear preconditioning) • Acceleration methods – Nonlinear GMRES – Objective acceleration • Derivative-free methods – Nelder–Mead – Simulated annealing – Particle swarm • Interval bound univariate methods Mogensen et al., (2018). Optim: A mathematical optimization package for Julia. Journal of Open Source Software, 3(24), 615. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00615 1 – Brent's method – Golden-section search The derivative based methods use line searches to assist convergence. Multiple line search algorithms are available, including interpolating backtracking and methods that aim to satisfy the Wolfe conditions. The optimization routines in this package have been used in both industrial and academic contexts. For example, parts of the internal work in the company Ternary Intelligence Inc. (Paramonov 2017) rely on the package. Notably, an upcoming book on optimization (Kochenderfer and Wheeler Forthcoming, 2018) uses Optim for its examples. Optim has been used for a wide range of applications in academic research, including optimal con-trol (Riseth, Dewynne, and Farmer 2017; Riseth 2017a), parameter estimation (Riseth and Taylor-King 2017; Rackauckas and Nie 2017; and Dony, He, and Stumpf 2018), quan-tum physics (Damle, Levitt, and Lin 2018), crystalline modelling (Chen and Ortner 2017; Braun, Buze, and Ortner 2017), and the large-scale astronomical cataloguing project Ce-leste (Regier et al. 2015; Regier et al. 2016). A new acceleration scheme for optimization (Riseth 2017b), and a preconditioning scheme for geometry optimisation (Packwood et al. 2016) have also been tested within the Optim framework.},

abstract = {We investigate unconstrained optimization with an objective function that has an unknown and possibly large number of local minima. By varying the selection and termination criteria, we obtain several variants of the Moore-Skelboe algorithm for distinct tasks in nonconvex global optimization. All of these terminate after having found the best answer that is possible, given the precision of the underlying hardware and given the expression for the objective function. The first algorithm finds the best lower bound for the global minimum. This is then extended to a version that adds an upper bound. Often not only the global minimum is required, but also possibly existing points that achieve near-optimality, yet are far from the points at which the global minimum occurs. In response to this requirement we define the AE-minimizer, the set of points at which the objective function is within AE of the global minimum. We then present algorithms that return a set of boxes. In one of these, the union of the boxes in this set contains a AE-minimizer. If this union is small, then we know that there is a well-defined global minimum. In the other version, the union of the boxes returned is contained in a AE-minimizer. If this union is large, then we know that there is a wide choice of parameters that yield near-optimal objective function values.},

Even without imposing the constraints of any fabrication process, the resulting optimal gaps are only slightly larger than previous hand designs, suggesting that current photonic crystals are nearly optimal in this respect. However, optimization can discover new structures, e.g. a new fcc structure with the same symmetry but slightly larger gap than the well known inverse opal, which may offer new degrees of freedom to future fabrication technologies. Furthermore, our band-gap optimization is an illustration of a computational approach to 3D dispersion engineering which is applicable to many other problems in optics, based on a novel semidefinite-program formulation for nonconvex eigenvalue optimization combined with other techniques such as a simple approach to impose symmetry constraints. We also demonstrate a technique for $\backslash$emph{\{}robust{\}} topology optimization, in which some uncertainty is included in each voxel and we optimize the worst-case gap, and we show that the resulting band gaps have increased robustness to systematic fabrication errors.},

abstract = {This paper is to give an overview of AMG methods for solving large scale systems of equations such as those from the discretization of partial differential equations. AMG is often understood as the acronym of "Algebraic Multi-Grid", but it can also be understood as "Abstract Muti-Grid". Indeed, as it demonstrates in this paper, how and why an algebraic multigrid method can be better understood in a more abstract level. In the literature, there are a variety of different algebraic multigrid methods that have been developed from different perspectives. In this paper, we try to develop a unified framework and theory that can be used to derive and analyze different algebraic multigrid methods in a coherent manner. Given a smoother {\$}R{\$} for a matrix {\$}A{\$}, such as Gauss-Seidel or Jacobi, we prove that the optimal coarse space of dimension {\$}n{\_}c{\$} is the span of the eigen-vectors corresponding to the first {\$}n{\_}c{\$} eigenvalues of {\$}\backslashbar RA{\$} (with {\$}\backslashbar R=R+R{\^{}}T-R{\^{}}TAR{\$}). We also prove that this optimal coarse space can be obtained by a constrained trace-minimization problem for a matrix associated with {\$}\backslashbar RA{\$} and demonstrate that coarse spaces of most of existing AMG methods can be viewed some approximate solution of this trace-minimization problem. Furthermore, we provide a general approach to the construction of a quasi-optimal coarse space and we prove that under appropriate assumptions the resulting two-level AMG method for the underlying linear system converges uniformly with respect to the size of the problem, the coefficient variation, and the anisotropy. Our theory applies to most existing multigrid methods, including the standard geometric multigrid method, the classic AMG, energy-minimization AMG, unsmoothed and smoothed aggregation AMG, and spectral AMGe.},

These new measures are used to determine local representations of algebraically "smooth" error components that provide the basis for constructing effective interpolation and, hence, the coarsening process for AMG. Here, we focus on the interpolation process; choice of the coarse "grids" based on these measures is the subject of current research.

The focus of this article is on a fully parallel topology optimization framework implemented in C++, with emphasis on utilizing well tested and simple to implement linear solvers and optimization algorithms. However, to ensure generality, the code is developed to be easily extendable in terms of physical models as well as in terms of solution methods, without compromising the parallel scalability. The widely used Method of Moving Asymptotes optimization algorithm is parallelized and included as a fundamental part of the code.

Special data structures are designed for high performance and to keep the memory requirements to a minimum.

In this paper, we suggest a nondominated sorting-based multiobjective EA (MOEA), called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm Il (NSGA-II). which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast nondominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) N solutions. Simulation results on difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to Pareto-archived evolution strategy and strength-Pareto EA-two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multiobjective problems efficiently.

A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm is applied as a heuristic optimization engine to optimize the control points, weights and knots of the curves in order to smooth and refine the boundaries of the topology. The main advantage of a multi-objective approach is that the designer can identify, explore and refine a number of tradeoff topologies.

abstract = {This study utilizes computational topology optimization methods for the systematic design of optimal multifunctional silicon anode structures for lithium-ion batteries. In order to develop next generation high performance lithium-ion batteries, key design challenges relating to the silicon anode structure must be addressed, namely the lithiation-induced mechanical degradation and the low intrinsic electrical conductivity of silicon. As such this work considers two design objectives, the first being minimum compliance under design dependent volume expansion, and the second maximum electrical conduction through the structure, both of which are subject to a constraint on material volume. Density-based topology optimization methods are employed in conjunction with regularization techniques, a continuation scheme, and mathematical programming methods. The objectives are first considered individually, during which the influence of the minimum structural feature size and prescribed volume fraction are investigated. The methodology is subsequently extended to a bi-objective formulation to simultaneously address both the structural and conduction design criteria. The weighted sum method is used to derive the Pareto fronts, which demonstrate a clear trade-off between the competing design objectives. A rigid frame structure was found to be an excellent compromise between the structural and conduction design criteria, providing both the required structural rigidity and direct conduction pathways. The developments and results presented in this work provide a foundation for the informed design and development of silicon anode structures for high performance lithium-ion batteries.},

abstract = {Topology optimization has been used in many industries and applied to a variety of design problems. In real-world engineering design problems, topology opti-mization problems often include a number of conflicting objective functions, such to achieve maximum stiffness and minimum mass of a design target. The existence of conflict-ing objective functions causes the results of the topology optimization problem to appear as a set of non-dominated solutions, called a Pareto-optimal solution set. Within such a solution set, a design engineer can easily choose the particu-lar solution that best meets the needs of the design problem at hand. Pareto-optimal solution sets can provide useful insights that enable the structural features corresponding to a certain objective function to be isolated and explored. This paper proposes a new Pareto frontier exploration method-ology for multiobjective topology optimization problems. In our methodology, a level set-based topology optimiza-tion method for a single-objective function is extended for use in multiobjective problems, using a population-based approach in which multiple points in the objective space are updated and moved to the Pareto frontier. The following two schemes are introduced so that Pareto-optimal solution sets can be efficiently obtained. First, weighting coeffi-cients are adaptively determined considering the relative position of each point. Second, points in sparsely populated areas are selected and their neighborhoods are explored. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Among the structural optimization methods, this article cou- ples solid isotropic material with penalization parametrization (SIMP) with an aggregated objective function approach (AOF) to tackle this topology optimization problem through a multiobjective strategy. Both average and variance temperature-reduction problems is solved by the identification of Pareto fronts, which are highly dependent on the quantity of the high-conductivity material. This study also underlines the link between the sensitivity analysis of both objective functions, which is required by the method of moving asymptotes (MMA). Furthermore, additional calculations have been done to include variations in heat-generation rate between two conductive materials by means of an additional penaliza- tion strategy. The main conclusion deals with the possibility of finding an acceptable trade-off between average and variance objective functions thanks to the convex shape of Pareto frontiers.},

abstract = {Multiple degree-of-freedom compliant mechanisms are widely used in the fields of micropositioning and micro-manipulation. This paper deals with multiobjective topology optimization of multi-input and multi-output compliant mechanisms undergoing large deformation. The objective function is defined by the minimum compliance and maximum geometric advantage to meet both stiffness and flexibility requirements. The suppression strategy of input and output coupling terms is studied and the expression of the output coupling terms is further developed. The weighted sum of the conflicting objectives resulting from the norm method is used to generate the optimal compromise solutions, and the decision function is set to select the preferred solution. Geometrically nonlinear mechanism response is calculated using the Total-Lagrange finite element formulation and the equilibrium is found using an incremental scheme combined with Newton-Raphson iterations. The solid isotropic material with penalization approach is used in design of compliant mechanisms. The sensitivities of the objective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. Numerical examples of multiple inputs and outputs are presented to show the validity of the new method. Simulation results show that the compliant mechanisms can be deformed in the desirable manner and the coupling output displacements are suppressed significantly by using the presented method. {\textcopyright} (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

In order to improve the performance of the GA's (despite the presence of binary topology variables) a novel approach based on kinematic stability repair (KSR) is proposed. The methodology consists of two parts, namely the creation of a number of kinematically stable individuals in the initial population (IP) and a chromosome repair procedure. The proposed method is developed for both 2D and 3D structures and is shown to produce (in the single-objective case) results which are better than, or equal to, those found in the literature, while significantly increasing the rate of convergence of the algorithm. In the multiobjective case, the proposed modifications produce superior results compared to the unmodified GA. Finally the algorithm is successfully applied to a cantilevered 3D structure.},

@article{Mahdavi2006,
abstract = {Topology optimization is often used in the conceptual design stage as a preprocessing tool to obtain overall material distribution in the solution domain. The resulting topology is then used as an initial guess for shape optimization. It is always desirable to use fine computational grids to obtain high-resolution layouts that minimize the need for shape optimization and postprocessing (Bendsoe and Sigmund, Topology optimization theory, methods and applications. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg NewYork 2003), but this approach results in high computation cost and is prohibitive for large structures. In the present work, parallel computing in combination with domain decomposition is proposed to reduce the computation time of such problems. The power law approach is used as the material distribution method, and an optimality criteria-based optimizer is used for locating the optimum solution [Sigmund (2001)21:120–127; Rozvany and Olhoff, Topology optimization of structures and composites continua. Kluwer, Norwell 2000]. The equilibrium equations are solved using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. These calculations have been done using a master–slave programming paradigm on a coarse-grain, multiple instruction multiple data, shared-memory architecture. In this study, by avoiding the assembly of the global stiffness matrix, the memory requirement and computation time has been reduced. The results of the current study show that the parallel computing technique is a valuable tool for solving computationally intensive topology optimization problems.},

Since the implementation ensures C(0)continuity of design variables, it is immune to element-wise that are a concern with element-based design variables. Nevertheless, in a subset of design examples considered, especially those involving compliance minimization with coarse meshes, the implementation is found to introduce a new phenomenon that takes the form of "layering" or "islanding" in the material layout design. In the examples studied, this phenomenon disappears with mesh refinement or the enforcement of sufficiently restrictive design perimeter constraints, the latter sometimes being necessary in design problems involving bending to ensure convergence with mesh refinement.

The topology optimization problem is modelled using a density approach and thus, is classified as a nonconvex problem. More specifically, the SQP method is designed for the classical minimum compliance problem with a constraint on the volume of the structure. The sub-problems are defined using second-order information. They are reformulated using the specific mathematical properties of the problem to significantly improve the efficiency of the solver. The performance of the TopSQP solver is compared to the special-purpose structural optimization method, the Globally Convergent Method of Moving Asymptotes (GCMMA) and the two general nonlinear solvers IPOPT and SNOPT. Numerical experiments on a large set of benchmark problems show good performance of TopSQP in terms of number of function evaluations.

In conjunction with a comprehensive software platform, the CUDA Architecture enables programmers to draw on the immense power of graphics processing units (GPUs) when building high-performance applications. GPUs, of course, have long been available for demanding graphics and game applications. CUDA now brings this valuable resource to programmers working on applications in other domains, including science, engineering, and finance. No knowledge of graphics programming is required-just the ability to program in a modestly extended version of C. CUDA by Example, written by two senior members of the CUDA software platform team, shows programmers how to employ this new technology. The authors introduce each area of CUDA development through working examples. After a concise introduction to the CUDA platform and architecture, as well as a quick-start guide to CUDA C, the book details the techniques and trade-offs associated with each key CUDA feature. You'll discover when to use each CUDA C extension and how to write CUDA software that delivers truly outstanding performance.

abstract = {Structural topology optimisation has mainly been applied to strength and stiffness objectives, due to the ease of calculating the sensitivities for such problems. In con-trast, dynamic and buckling objectives require time consum-ing central difference schemes, or inefficient non-gradient algorithms, for calculation of the sensitivities. Further, soft-kill algorithms suffer from numerous numerical issues, such as localised artificial modes and mode switching. This has resulted in little focus on structural topology optimisation for dynamic and buckling objectives. In this work it is found that nominal stress contours can be derived from applying the vibration and buckling mode shapes as dis-placement fields, defined as the dynamic and buckling von Mises stress, respectively. This paper shows that there is an equivalence between the dynamic von Mises stress and the frequency sensitivity numbers for element removal and addition in bidirectional evolutionary structural optimisa-tion. Likewise, it was found that the contours of buckling von Mises stress and buckling sensitivity numbers are anal-ogous; therefore, an equivalence is shown for element removal and addition. The examples demonstrate consis-tent resulting topologies from the two different formulations for both dynamic and buckling criteria. This article aims to develop a simple alternative, based on visual correlation with a mathematical verification, for topology optimisation with dynamic and buckling criteria.},

abstract = {—GPUs and other accelerators are popular devices for accelerating compute-intensive, parallelizable applications. However, programming these devices is a difficult task. Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language. We evaluate our approach by adding support for NVIDIA GPUs to the Julia programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for GPU programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining application performance similar to that of the official NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.},

To restrict the minimum mass problem to withstand a prescribed finite accumulated damage, constraints are formulated using Palmgren-Miner's linear damage hypothesis, S-N curves, and the Sines fatigue criterion. Utilizing aggregation functions and the accumulative nature of Palmgren-Miner's rule, an adjoint formulation is applied where the amount of adjoint problems that must be solved is independent of the amount of cycles in the load spectrum. Consequently, large load histories can be included directly in the optimization with minimal additional computational costs. The method is currently limited to proportional loading conditions and linear elastic material behavior and a quasi-static structural analysis, but can be applied to various equivalent stress-based fatigue criteria. Optimized designs are presented for benchmark examples and compared to stress optimized designs for static loads.},

The problem aims at the minimization of the weight of linear elastic structures under given loads and boundary conditions. The expected stiffness of the optimal structure is provided by the global constraint, whereas a set of local stress–based constraints ask for a structure to be fatigue resistant. A modified Good-man fatigue strength comparison is implemented through the same formalism to address pressure–dependent fail-ure in materials as in Drucker–Prager strength criterion. As a simplification, the Sines approach is used to define the equivalent mean and alternating stresses to address the fatigue resistance for an infinite life time. Sines computation is based on the equivalent mean and alternate stress depend-ing on the invariants of the stress tensor and its deviatoric part, respectively. The so–called singularity phenomenon is overcome by the implementation of a suitable qp-relaxation of the equivalent stress measures. Numerical examples are Maxime Collet presented to illustrate the features of the achieved optimal layouts and of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {The Fritz John conditions for Pareto-optimality have been set in matrix form and used for introducing a procedure for the analytical derivation of the Pareto-optimal set in the design variables domain. Subsequently, the derivation of the Pareto-optimal set in the objective functions domain can be obtained, if possible, by a proper analytical derivation. Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be available in analytical form and twice differentiable and convex (or pseudo-convex). The proposed procedure to find the Pareto-optimal set is relatively simple. The computation of the determinant of a matrix is required. A symbolic manipulator can be exploited. If there are two design variables and two objective functions, the Pareto-optimal set can be easily computed by applying a simple formula derived in the paper. If the number of design variables equals the number of objective functions, the Pareto-optimal set in the design variables domain can be found by computing the product of the constraint functions times the determinant of the Jacobian of the objective functions. A number of case studies have been proposed to test the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. The optimal structural design of, respectively, a pair of compressed spheres, a cantilever with rectangular cross section have been faced and solved. Additionally the test problem proposed by Fonseca and Fleming has been addressed and solved analytically. Optimization problems with low dimensionality (2 or 3 design variables and 2 objective functions, 2 or more constraints) have been easily solved. The proposed procedure can be useful in the actual engineering practice at the earliest design stage. In this case the designer can be made aware on the proper design variables setting to obtain the desired tradeoff among conflicting objective functions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Variability of load magnitude/direction is a most significant source of uncertainties in practical engineering. This paper investigates robust topology optimization of structures subjected to uncertain dynamic excitations. The unknown-but-bounded dynamic loads/accelerations are described with the non-probabilistic ellipsoid convex model. The aim of the optimization problem is to minimize the absolute dynamic compliance for the worst-case loading condition. For this purpose, a generalized compliance matrix is defined to construct the objective function. To find the optimal structural layout under uncertain dynamic excitations, we first formulate the robust topology optimization problem into a nested double-loop one. Here, the inner-loop aims to seek the worst-case combination of the excitations (which depends on the current design, and is usually to be found by a global optimization algorithm), and the outer-loop optimizes the structural topology under the found worst-case excitation. To tackle the inherent difficulties associated with such an originally nested formulation, we convert the inner-loop into an inhomogeneous eigenvalue problem using the optimality condition. Thus the double-loop problem is reformulated into an equivalent single-loop one. This formulation ensures that the strict-sense worst-case combination of the uncertain excitations for each intermediate design be located without resorting to a time-consuming global search algorithm. The sensitivity analysis of the worst-case objective function value is derived with the adjoint variable method, and then the optimization problem is solved by a gradient-based mathematical programming method. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {The Energy based topology optimization method has been used in the design of compliant mechanisms for many years. Although many successful examples from the energy based topology optimization method have been presented, optimized configurations of these designs are often very similar to their rigid linkage counterparts; except using compliant joints in place of rigid links. These complaint joints will endure large strain under the applied forces in order to perform the specified motions which are very undesirable in a compliant mechanism design. In this paper, a strain based topology optimization method is proposed to avoid a localized high strain of the compliant mechanism design, which is one of the drawbacks using strain energy formulation. Therefore, instead of minimizing the strain energy for structural rigidity, a global effective strain function is minimized. This is done in order to distribute the strain within the entire mechanism while maximizing the structural rigidity. Furthermore, the physical programming method is adopted to accommodate both flexibility and rigidity design objectives. Design examples from both the strain energy based topology optimization and the strain based method are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to apply stress constraints to structural topology optimization problems with design-dependent loading. A comparison of mass-constrained compliance minimization solutions and stress-constrained mass minimization solutions is also provided. Although design-dependent loading has been the subject of previous research, only compliance minimization has been studied. Stress-constrained mass minimization problems are solved in this paper, and the results are compared with those of compliance minimization problems for the same geometries and loading. A stress-relaxation technique is used to avoid the singularity in the stress constraints, and these constraints are aggregated in blocks to reduce the total number of constraints in the optimization problem. The results show that these design-dependent loading problems may converge to a local minimum when the stress constraints are enforced. The use of a continuation method where the stress-constraint aggregation parameter is gradually increased typically leads to better convergence; however, this may not always be possible. The results also show that the topologies of compliance-minimization and stress-constrained solutions are usually vastly different, and the sizing optimization of a compliance solution may not lead to an optimum.},

Besides generating reasonable designs of frame structures themselves, frame topology optimization may serve as a tool providing us with conceptual designs of diverse engineering structures. Due to its nonconvexity, however, most of existing approaches to frame topology optimization are local optimization methods based on nonlinear programming with continuous design variables or (meta)heuristics allowing some discrete design variables. Presented in this paper is a new global opti-mization approach to the frame topology optimization with discrete design variables. It is shown that the compliance minimization problem with predetermined candidate cross-sections can be formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem. The global optimal solution is then computed with an existing solver based on a branch-and-cut algorithm. Numerical experiments are per-formed to examine computational efficiency of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {A new approach for generating stress-constrained topological designs in continua is presented. The main novelty is in the use of elasto-plastic modeling and in optimizing the design such that it will exhibit a linear-elastic response. This is achieved by imposing a single global constraint on the total sum of equivalent plastic strains, providing accurate control over all local stress violations. The single constraint essentially replaces a large number of local stress constraints or an approximate aggrega-tion of them–two common approaches in the literature. A classical rate-independent plasticity model is utilized, for which analytical adjoint sensitivity analysis is derived and verified. Several examples demonstrate the capability of the computational procedure to generate designs that challenge results from the literature, in terms of the obtained stiffness-strength-weight trade-offs. A full elasto-plastic analysis of the optimized designs shows that prior to the initial yielding, these designs can sustain sig-nificantly higher loads than minimum compliance topological layouts, with only a minor compromise on stiffness.},

The objective of the design problem is to max- imize the structural ductility which is defined by the integral of the strain energy over a given range of a prescribed displacement. The mass in the design space is prescribed. The design variables are the densities of the finite elements. The optimization problem is solved by a gradient based OC algorithm.

A geometrically adaptive optimization pro- cedure is applied in order to avoid artificial stress singularities and to increase the numerical efficiency of the optimization process. The geometric parametrization of the design model is adapted during the optimization process. Elastoplastic structural analy- sis is outlined. An efficient algorithm is introduced to determine the gradient of the ductility with respect to the densities of the finite elements.

abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive review of structural optimization employing topology methods for structures under vibration problems. Topology optimization allows creative and radical design modifications, compared to shape and size optimization techniques. Various works of structural topology optimization, which are subjected to vibration as the response function of the optimization process, are reviewed. Different types of calculus and numerical methods commonly used for solving structural topological optimization problems are briefly discussed. Moreover, different aspects of topology optimization related to vibration problems are explained. The articles reviewed are largely confined to linear systems that concern small vibration amplitudes. Accordingly, the works related to vibration topological optimization are classified according to the method employed (homogenization, evolutionary structural optimization, solid isotropic material with penalization, or level set). The reviewed works are tabulated according to their methodology, year, and the objective functions and applications of each work. Although the homogenization and evolutionary methods were common in the past, the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method is the most popular method applied in recent years. The advantages of the level set method show promise for future applications.},

abstract = {Previous research on topology optimization focussed primarily on global structural behaviour such as stiffness and frequencies. However, to obtain a true optimum design of a vehicle structure, stresses must be considered. The major difficulties in stress based topology optimization problems are two-fold. First, a large number of constraints must be considered, since unlike stiffness, stress is a local quantity. This problem increases the computational complexity of both the optimization and sensitivity analysis associated with the conventional topology optimization problem. The other difficulty is that since stress is highly nonlinear with respect to design variables, the move limit is essential for convergence in the optimization process. In this research, global stress functions are used to approximate local stresses. The density method is employed for solving the topology optimization problems. Three numerical examples are used for this investigation. The results show that a minimum stress design can be achieved and that a maximum stiffness design is not necessarily equivalent to a minimum stress design.},

Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

Part design for this hybrid manufacturing approach has been done by trial-and-error, and no dedicated design methodology exists for this manufacturing approach. To address this issue, this work presents a topology optimization method for hybrid additive and subtractive manufacturing. To be specific, the boundary segments of the input design domain are categorized into two types: (i) Freeform boundary segments freely evolve through the casting SIMP method, and (ii) shape preserved boundary segments suppress the freeform evolvement and are composed of machining features through a feature fitting algorithm. Given the manufacturing strategy, the topology design is produced through additive manufacturing and the shape preserved boundary segments will be processed by post-machining. This novel topology optimization algorithm is developed under a unified SIMP and level set framework. The effectiveness of the algorithm is proved through a few numerical case studies.},

abstract = {Topology optimization has been used in many industries and applied to a variety of design problems. In real-world engineering design problems, topology opti-mization problems often include a number of conflicting objective functions, such to achieve maximum stiffness and minimum mass of a design target. The existence of conflict-ing objective functions causes the results of the topology optimization problem to appear as a set of non-dominated solutions, called a Pareto-optimal solution set. Within such a solution set, a design engineer can easily choose the particu-lar solution that best meets the needs of the design problem at hand. Pareto-optimal solution sets can provide useful insights that enable the structural features corresponding to a certain objective function to be isolated and explored. This paper proposes a new Pareto frontier exploration method-ology for multiobjective topology optimization problems. In our methodology, a level set-based topology optimiza-tion method for a single-objective function is extended for use in multiobjective problems, using a population-based approach in which multiple points in the objective space are updated and moved to the Pareto frontier. The following two schemes are introduced so that Pareto-optimal solution sets can be efficiently obtained. First, weighting coeffi-cients are adaptively determined considering the relative position of each point. Second, points in sparsely populated areas are selected and their neighborhoods are explored. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The proposed approach starts with a single uniform material distribution pattern and ends by the optimized layout, without a need for prior knowledge about the objective function. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we tested it by solving eight benchmark problems of compliance minimization with variations in load cases, boundary conditions and topological details.

In addition, the mutation factor of DE is set to be a random number to enrich the search behavior, and the satisfaction level increases monotonously to gradually stress the feasibility. The comparison results between the DELC and five existing algorithms from the literature based on 13 widely used constrained benchmark functions show that the DELC is of better or competitive performance. Furthermore, the DELC is used to solve some typical engineering design problems. DELC is of superior searching quality on all the problems with fewer evaluation times than other algorithms. In addition, the effect of the increasing rate of satisfaction level on the performances of the DELC is investigated as well.},

Two test functions are applied to verify the MBDE framework with the new binary mutationmechanism, and four structural topology optimiza- tion problems are used to study the performance of the proposed MBDE algorithm. The experimental studies show that the proposed MBDE algorithm is not only suitable for structural topology optimization, but also has high viability in terms of solving numerical optimization problems.},

@article{Munk2015,
abstract = {Topology optimization has evolved rapidly since the late 1980s. The optimization of the geometry and topol-ogy of structures has a great impact on its performance, and the last two decades have seen an exponential increase in publications on structural optimization. This has mainly been due to the success of material distribution methods, originating in 1988, for generating optimal topologies of structural elements. Previous methods suffered from math-ematical complexity and a limited scope for applicability, however with the advent of increased computational power and new techniques topology optimization has grown into a design tool used by industry. There are two main fields in structural topology optimization, gradient based, where mathematical models are derived to calculate the sensitivi-ties of the design variables, and non gradient based, where material is removed or included using a sensitivity function. Both fields have been researched in great detail over the last two decades, to the point where structural topology opti-mization has been applied to real world structures. It is the objective of this review paper to present an overview of the developments in non gradient based structural topol-ogy and shape optimization, with a focus on evolutionary algorithms, which began as a non gradient method, but have developed to incorporate gradient based techniques. Starting with the early work and development of the popular algorithms and focusing on the various applications. The sensitivity functions for various optimization tasks are pre- sented and real world applications are analyzed. The article concludes with new applications of topology optimization and applications in various engineering fields.},

This paper presents a global optimization of the disc of a butterfly valve by the combination of topology and shape optimization techniques. Topology optimization is employed during concept design stage to evaluate the best material distribution from a structural performance point of view. Then, based on the topology optimization results, a shape optimization, managed by Genetic Algorithms (GAs), is conducted considering structural and fluid dynamics at the same time.

abstract = {Large-scale structural optimization often re- quires numerous finite element analyses to assess the fea- sibility of the derived solutions during the optimization process, which consume most of the computational cost. To enhance the computational efficiency, this study intro- duces a filter strategy aiming to eliminate the redundant constraint violation evaluations in large-scale structural optimization using metaheuristic algorithms. Based on the solution selection rule, this study separates the metaheuristic algorithms into two categories: replacement and elitism. The filter mechanism founds on elitism of the metaheuristic algorithms and reduces substantially the number of structural analyses without compromising the effectiveness of the optimization algorithms and the con- straint handling techniques. This study also defines a pa- rameter, R, to assess the enhancement performance of the computational efficiency improved by the proposed meth- od. Results from both mathematical simulations and two large-scale structural optimization examples using various metaheuristic algorithms demonstrate that the harmony search (HS) leads always to the lowest R value. The R value is less than 0.4 and is even as small as 0.09 for the 942-bar example, which means over 90{\%} of time savings compared with the penalty method and the Deb rule and the quality of the final optimum also does not depend on the value of R.},

abstract = {The theory of least-weight trusses for one load condition and a stress constraint was established by Michell (Philos Mag 8:589-597, 1904). His work was largely ignored for about 50 years, but from then on, a lot of research effort has been devoted to construct optimal topologies satisfying Michell's optimality criteria. But the exact analytical Michell layout is still not known for most boundary conditions. It is therefore useful to develop numerical methods for generating approximate Michell-like topologies. We show in this paper that genetic ESO (GESO) methods are suitable for constructing Michell-like layouts. To illustrate the validity of GESO, seven different load cases for a plane structure with two point supports are considered. The Michell-like layouts are generated for vertical or horizontal loads applied at different heights and different angles. The results are compared and classified and a new Michell truss is proposed on the basis of the GESO results. Plane structures under two point loads are also considered, and the GESO results are compared with Melchers (Struct Multidisc Optim 29:85-92, 2005) solutions.},

abstract = {The evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) method has been under continuous development since 1992. Originally the method was conceived from the engineering perspective that the topology and shape of structures were naturally conservative for safety reasons and therefore contained an excess of material. To move from the conservative design to a more optimum design would therefore involve the removal of material. The ESO algorithm caters for topology optimization by allowing the removal of material from all parts of the design space. With appropriate chequer-board controls and controls on the number of cavities formed, the method can reproduce traditional fully stressed topologies. If the algorithm was restricted to the removal of surface-only material, then a shape optimization problem (along the lines of the Min-Max type problem) is solved. Recent research by the authors has presented and benchmarked an additive evolutionary structural optimization (AESO) algorithm that, with appropriate decision making, starts the evolutionary optimization procedure from a minimal kernel structure that connects the loading points to the mechanical constraints. Naturally this is unevenly and overly stressed, and material is subsequently added to the surface to reduce localized high stress regions. AESO only adds material to the surface, the present work describes the combining of basic ESO with the AESO to produce bi-directional ESO (BESO) whereby material can be added and removed. This paper shows that this method provides the same results as the traditional ESO. This has two benefits, it validates the ESO concept, and as the examples demonstrate, BESO can arrive at an optimum faster than ESO. This is especially true for 3D structures, since the structure grows from a small initial one rather than contracting from a, sometimes, huge initial one where around 90{\%} of the material gets removed over many hundreds of finite element analysis (FEA) evolutionary cycles. Both 2D and 3D structures are examined and multiple load cases are applied.},

@article{Tanskanen2002,
abstract = {In 1993, Y.M. Xie and G.P. Steven introduced an approach called evolutionary structural optimization (ESO). ESO is based on the simple idea that the optimal structure (maximum stiffness, minimum weight) can be produced by gradually removing the ineffectively used material from the design domain. The design domain is constructed by the FE method, and furthermore, external loads and support conditions are applied to the element model. Considering the engineering aspects, ESO seems to have some attractive features: The ESO method is very simple to program via the FEA packages and requires a relatively small amount of FEA time. Additionally, the ESO topologies have been compared with analytical ones, e.g. Michell trusses, and so far the results are quite promising. On the other hand, ESO does not have a solid theoretical basis, and consequently, the ESO minimization problem is still unresolved. Since the good agreement between the results cannot be just a coincidence, in this paper, we will study whether the gradual removal of material can be explained mathematically and whether the theoretical basis of ESO can be outlined. First, a minimization problem solved by ESO is examined. Based on the results of earlier publications, it was assumed that the ESO method minimizes the compliance-volume product of a structure or a finite element model. It was noted that the sequential linear programming (SLP)-based approximate optimization method followed by the Simplex algorithm is equivalent to ESO if the strain energy rejection criterion is utilized. However, ESO should be applied so that the elements corresponding to the design domain are equally sized. If this requirement is not met, the rejection criterion, which also considers the varying sizes of the elements, should be used. Additionally, the element stiffness matrices and element volumes should be linearly dependent on the design variables. Also linearly elastic material is assumed. At each iteration the rejected elements should be removed completely. Most often only element removal is allowed in ESO. If the design variables are initially assigned values other than the maximum value, however, the elements should be allowed to reenter the design domain. This subject, obviously, needs further study. Typically, ESO is applied to problems having a planar design domain with in-plane forces only. In these cases, ESO produces truss-like, equally stressed and maximum-stiffness topologies. It is often recommended that, based on the topology optimization, a new finite element discretization should be employed. After that, the sizing optimization procedure can be performed. Since ESO seems to be producing truss-like topologies, ESO should be applied to structural problems having pinjointed connections. For other types of structures ESO should be studied further. Finally, it can be concluded that ESO is not just an intuitive method, as it has a very distinct theoretical basis. It is also very simple to employ in engineering design problems. For this reason, ESO has potential to become a tool for design engineers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method has been under continuous development since 1992. Traditionally, the method was conceived from the engineering perspective that the topology and shape of structures were naturally conservative for safety reasons and therefore contained an excess of material. To move from the conservative design to a more optimum design would therefore involve the removal of material. Thus the ESO method started from a design space much bigger than the optimum and the final topology or shape emerged by a process of removal of unwanted/inefficient/lowly stresses material. The original algorithms allowed for two forms of evolution. One was there the understressed material could be removed from anywhere in the allowable design space, and with compensation for checker-boarding this produces an optimum topology under the prescribed environments. The second form only allows removal from the surface or parts of the surface (called nibbling in the ESO lexicon); this produces a Min-Max situation where the maximum surface stress is reduced to a minimum. It has been demonstrated that the ESO process produces a surface that is an iso-stress contour thus satisfying the Min-Max optimality criterion. The present paper addresses the opposite evolutionary process whereby the structure evolves from a base which is the minimum structural form required to carry the load regardless of the magnitude of the stress levels. Material is added in the proximity of high stress to ameliorate its effect and hence the final structural form emerges. Only singly connected regions are formed in the present analysis and thus the additive ESO process is the opposite of the nibbling SO, mentioned above, that produces optimum surface shapes. The paper presents a brief background to the current state of structural optimisation research. This is followed by a discussion of the strategies for the additive ESO (AESO) algorithm and two examples are presented.},

When a boundary support is broken, the structural system could be completely changed from the one originally defined in the initial design and even BESO would not be able to rectify the nonoptimal design. To avoid this problem, it is imperative that the prescribed boundary conditions for the structure be checked and maintained at each iteration during the optimization process. Several simple procedures for solving this problem are suggested. The benchmark problem proposed by Zhou and Rozvany (Struct Multidisc Optim 21:80–83, 2001) is revisited, and it is shown that the highly nonoptimal design can be easily avoided.},

Every point in space is thus a material point or a void and the optimization problem is a discrete variable one. This paper describes various ways of removing this discrete nature of the problem by the introduc- tion of a density function that is a continuous design variable. Domains of high density then define the shape of the mechanical element. For intermediate densities, material parameters given by an artificial material law can be used. Alternatively, the den- sity can arise naturally through the introduction of periodically distributed, microscopic voids, so that effective material param- eters for intermediate density values can be computed through homogenization. Several examples in two-dimensional elastic- ity illustrate that these methods allow a determination of the topology of a mechanical element, as required for a boundary variations shape optimization technique.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

In general, the results from ESO are likely to be local optimums other than the global optimum desired. In this paper, the genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated with ESO to form a new algorithm called Genetic Evolutionary Structural Optimization (GESO), which takes the advantage of the excellent behavior of the GA in searching for global optimums. For the developed GESO method, each element in finite element analysis is an individual and has its own fitness value according to the magnitude of its sensitivity number. Then, all elements in an initial domain constitute a whole population in GA. After a number of generations, undeleted elements will converge to the optimal result that will be more likely to be a global optimum than that of ESO. To avoid missing the optimum layout of a structure in the evolution, an interim thickness is introduced into GESO and its validity is demonstrated by an example. A stiffness optimization with weight constraints and a weight optimization with displacement constraints are studied as numerical examples to investigate the effectiveness of GESO by comparison with the performance of ESO. It is shown through the examples that the developed GESO method has powerful capacity in searching for global optimal results and requires less computational effort than ESO and other existing methods.},

The present paper suggests that there are computational benefits to treating this nested problem as a large single optimization problem. That is, the response variables (such as displacements) and the structural parameters are all treated as design variables in a unified formulation which performs simultaneously the design and analysis. Two examples are used for demonstration. A 72-bar truss is optimized subject to linear stress constraints and a wing-box structure is optimized subject to nonlinear collapse constraints. Both examples show substantial computational savings with the unified approach as compared to the traditional nested approach.},

The boundary element method (BEM) is used for the structural analysis. For linear elasticity problems, it needs only a mesh on the boundary of the structure. This characteristic makes the BEM a natural method for shape optimization, since only the boundary is needed to define the optimization problem and to carry out the structural analysis. The simultaneous analysis and design formulation (SAND) for structural optimization considers the state variables as unknowns of the optimization problem and includes the equilibrium equations as equality constraints. In this way, it is not necessary to solve the equilibrium equation per iteration; the equilibrium is only obtained at the end of the optimization process. In this paper, the shape optimization problem is dealt with using the BEM formulation to define a SAND optimization problem that is solved using an interior point algorithm. Numerical results for two-dimensional linear elasticity problems are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.},

@article{Tanskanen2002a,
abstract = {In 1993, Y.M. Xie and G.P. Steven introduced an approach called evolutionary structural optimization (ESO). ESO is based on the simple idea that the optimal structure (maximum stiffness, minimum weight) can be produced by gradually removing the ineffectively used material from the design domain. The design domain is constructed by the FE method, and furthermore, external loads and support conditions are applied to the element model. Considering the engineering aspects, ESO seems to have some attractive features: The ESO method is very simple to program via the FEA packages and requires a relatively small amount of FEA time. Additionally, the ESO topologies have been compared with analytical ones, e.g. Michell trusses, and so far the results are quite promising. On the other hand, ESO does not have a solid theoretical basis, and consequently, the ESO minimization problem is still unresolved. Since the good agreement between the results cannot be just a coincidence, in this paper, we will study whether the gradual removal of material can be explained mathematically and whether the theoretical basis of ESO can be outlined. First, a minimization problem solved by ESO is examined. Based on the results of earlier publications, it was assumed that the ESO method minimizes the compliance-volume product of a structure or a finite element model. It was noted that the sequential linear programming (SLP)-based approximate optimization method followed by the Simplex algorithm is equivalent to ESO if the strain energy rejection criterion is utilized. However, ESO should be applied so that the elements corresponding to the design domain are equally sized. If this requirement is not met, the rejection criterion, which also considers the varying sizes of the elements, should be used. Additionally, the element stiffness matrices and element volumes should be linearly dependent on the design variables. Also linearly elastic material is assumed. At each iteration the rejected elements should be removed completely. Most often only element removal is allowed in ESO. If the design variables are initially assigned values other than the maximum value, however, the elements should be allowed to reenter the design domain. This subject, obviously, needs further study. Typically, ESO is applied to problems having a planar design domain with in-plane forces only. In these cases, ESO produces truss-like, equally stressed and maximum-stiffness topologies. It is often recommended that, based on the topology optimization, a new finite element discretization should be employed. After that, the sizing optimization procedure can be performed. Since ESO seems to be producing truss-like topologies, ESO should be applied to structural problems having pinjointed connections. For other types of structures ESO should be studied further. Finally, it can be concluded that ESO is not just an intuitive method, as it has a very distinct theoretical basis. It is also very simple to employ in engineering design problems. For this reason, ESO has potential to become a tool for design engineers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method has been under continuous development since 1992. Traditionally, the method was conceived from the engineering perspective that the topology and shape of structures were naturally conservative for safety reasons and therefore contained an excess of material. To move from the conservative design to a more optimum design would therefore involve the removal of material. Thus the ESO method started from a design space much bigger than the optimum and the final topology or shape emerged by a process of removal of unwanted/inefficient/lowly stresses material. The original algorithms allowed for two forms of evolution. One was there the understressed material could be removed from anywhere in the allowable design space, and with compensation for checker-boarding this produces an optimum topology under the prescribed environments. The second form only allows removal from the surface or parts of the surface (called nibbling in the ESO lexicon); this produces a Min-Max situation where the maximum surface stress is reduced to a minimum. It has been demonstrated that the ESO process produces a surface that is an iso-stress contour thus satisfying the Min-Max optimality criterion. The present paper addresses the opposite evolutionary process whereby the structure evolves from a base which is the minimum structural form required to carry the load regardless of the magnitude of the stress levels. Material is added in the proximity of high stress to ameliorate its effect and hence the final structural form emerges. Only singly connected regions are formed in the present analysis and thus the additive ESO process is the opposite of the nibbling SO, mentioned above, that produces optimum surface shapes. The paper presents a brief background to the current state of structural optimisation research. This is followed by a discussion of the strategies for the additive ESO (AESO) algorithm and two examples are presented.},

If the algorithm was restricted to the removal of surface-only material, then a shape optimization problem (along the lines of the Min-Max type problem) is solved. Recent research by the authors has presented and benchmarked an additive evolutionary structural optimization (AESO) algorithm that, with appropriate decision making, starts the evolutionary optimization procedure from a minimal kernel structure that connects the loading points to the mechanical constraints. Naturally this is unevenly and overly stressed, and material is subsequently added to the surface to reduce localized high stress regions. AESO only adds material to the surface, the present work describes the combining of basic ESO with the AESO to produce bi-directional ESO (BESO) whereby material can be added and removed. This paper shows that this method provides the same results as the traditional ESO. This has two benefits, it validates the ESO concept, and as the examples demonstrate, BESO can arrive at an optimum faster than ESO. This is especially true for 3D structures, since the structure grows from a small initial one rather than contracting from a, sometimes, huge initial one where around 90{\%} of the material gets removed over many hundreds of finite element analysis (FEA) evolutionary cycles. Both 2D and 3D structures are examined and multiple load cases are applied.},

This note further examines this important problem and shows that failure of ESO may occur when a prescribed boundary support is broken for a statically indeterminate structure. When a boundary support is broken, the structural system could be completely changed from the one originally defined in the initial design and even BESO would not be able to rectify the nonoptimal design. To avoid this problem, it is imperative that the prescribed boundary conditions for the structure be checked and maintained at each iteration during the optimization process. Several simple procedures for solving this problem are suggested. The benchmark problem proposed by Zhou and Rozvany (Struct Multidisc Optim 21:80–83, 2001) is revisited, and it is shown that the highly nonoptimal design can be easily avoided.},

The geometrically nonlinear behaviour of the structures are modelled using a total Lagrangian finite element for- mulation and the equilibrium is found using a Newton- Raphson iterative scheme. The sensitivities of the ob- jective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. A filtering scheme is used to obtain checkerboard-free and mesh-independent designs and a continuation approach improves convergence to efficient designs. Different objective functions are tested. Minimizing compliance for a fixed load results in degenerated topol- ogies which are very inefficient for smaller or larger loads. The problem of obtaining degenerated “optimal” topol- ogies which only can support the design load is evenmore pronounced than for structures with linear response. The problem is circumvented by optimizing the structures for multiple loading conditions or by minimizing the com- plementary elastic work. Examples show that differences in stiffnesses of structures optimized using linear and nonlinear modelling are generally small but they can be large in certain cases involving buckling or snap-through effects},

We placed CNTs on copper TEM grids for structural analysis and on AFM probes for the assembly of AFM super-tips. We used electrothermally actuated polysilicon microgrippers designed using topology optimization in the experiments. The microgrippers are able to open as well as close. Topology optimization leads to a 10-100 times improvement of the gripping force compared to conventional designs of similar size. Furthermore, we improved our nanorobotic system to offer more degrees of freedom. TEM investigation of the CNTs shows that the multi-walled tubes are coated with an amorphous carbon layer, which is locally removed at the contact points with the microgripper. The assembled AFM super-tips are used for AFM measurements of microstructures with high aspect ratios.},

Every point in space is thus a material point or a void and the optimization problem is a discrete variable one. This paper describes various ways of removing this discrete nature of the problem by the introduc- tion of a density function that is a continuous design variable. Domains of high density then define the shape of the mechanical element. For intermediate densities, material parameters given by an artificial material law can be used. Alternatively, the den- sity can arise naturally through the introduction of periodically distributed, microscopic voids, so that effective material param- eters for intermediate density values can be computed through homogenization. Several examples in two-dimensional elastic- ity illustrate that these methods allow a determination of the topology of a mechanical element, as required for a boundary variations shape optimization technique.},

The binary design variables indicate presence or absence of material in the finite elements. A common approach to solve these problems is to relax the binary constraints, i.e. allow the design variables to attain values between zero and one, and penalize intermediate values to obtain a "black and white" (zero-one) design. To avoid convergence to a local minimum, it has been suggested that a continuation method should be used, where the penalized problems are solved with increasing penalization. In this paper, the trajectories associated with optimal solutions to the penalized problems, for continuously increasing penalization, are studied on some carefully chosen examples. Two different penalization techniques are used. The global trajectory is defined as the path followed by the global optimal solutions to the penalized problems, and we present examples for which the global trajectory is discontinuous even though the original zero-one problem has a unique solution. Furthermore, we present examples where the penalization method combined with a continuation approach fails to produce a black and white design, no matter how large the penalization becomes.},

abstract = {This paper considers the transformer design optimization problem. In its most general form, the design problem requires minimizing the total mass (or cost) of the core and wire material while ensuring the satisfaction of the transformer ratings and a number of design constraints. The constraints include appropriate limits on efficiency, voltage regulation, temperature rise, no-load current, and winding fill factor. The design optimization seeks a constrained minimum mass (or cost) solution by optimally setting the transformer geometry parameters and the relevant electrical and magnetic quantities. In cases where the core dimensions are fixed, the optimization problem calls for a constrained maximum volt-ampere or minimum loss solution. This paper shows that the above design problems can be formulated in geometric programming (GP) format. The importance of the GP format stems from two main features. First, GP provides an efficient and reliable solution for the design optimization problem with several variables. Second, it guarantees that the obtained solution is the global optimum. The paper includes a demonstration of the application of the GP technique to transformer design. It also includes a comparative study to emphasize the advantage of including the transformer core dimensions as variables in the design problem.},

This paper also underlies the importance of using optimization strategies rather than handbook recommendations as well as pointing out the superiority of the multipass over the single-pass optimization approach.},

abstract = {We describe an active-set, dual-feasible Schur-complement method for quadratic programming (QP) with positive definite Hessians. The formulation of the QP being solved is general and flexible, and is appropriate for many different application areas. Moreover, the specialized structure of the QP is abstracted away behind a fixed KKT matrix called Ko and other problem matrices, which naturally leads to an object-oriented software implementation. Updates to the working set of active inequality constraints are facilitated using a dense Schur complement, which we expect to remain small. Here, the dual Schur complement method requires the projected Hessian to be positive definite for every working set considered by the algorithm. Therefore, this method is not appropriate for all QPs. While the Schur complement approach to linear algebra is very flexible with respect to allowing exploitation of problem structure, it is not as numerically stable as approaches using a QR factorization. However, we show that the use of fixed-precision iterative refinement helps to dramatically improve the numerical stability of this Schur complement algorithm. The use of the objectoriented QP solver implementation is demonstrated on two different application areas with specializations in each area; large-scale model predictive control (MPC) and reduced-space successive quadratic programming (with several different representations for the reduced Hessian). These results demonstrate that the QP solver can exploit application-specific structure in a computationally efficient and fairly robust manner as compared to other QP solver implementations.},

abstract = {Successive quadratic programming (SQP) has emerged as the algorithm of choice for solving moderately-sized nonlinear process optimization problems. However, as the nonlinear programming problem becomes large (over 100 variables, say) storage requirements for the Hessian matrix and the computational expense of solving large quadratic programs can become prohibitive. To overcome this problem, Westerberg and coworkers proposed two SQP decomposition strategies in 1980 and 1983. The first strategy overcomes this problem but is difficult to implement, while the second has been observed to give inconsistent results. The strategy in this paper uses range and null space projections to develop a decomposition algorithm that is both easy to implement and performs as well as the full SQP algorithm on small problems. This range and null space decomposition (RND) allows for sparse implementations and thus solves large problems easily and reliably. Theoretical development of the RND method is presented as well as a geometric interpretation of this approach compared to others. Finally, a thorough numerical comparison of SQP strategies is presented on a battery of nonlinear programming and process optimization test problems. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Typical chemical process optimization problems have a large number of equations, but relatively few degrees of freedom. A reduced Hessian successive quadratic programming (rSQP) algorithm has been shown to be successful in solving these types of models efficiently. While the rSQP algorithm reduces the dimension of the QP subproblem solved at each iteration, the number of inequality constraints could still become quite large. As a result, there is still a potentially large combinatorial expense to solving large NLPs with rSQP, as the solution of the QP subproblem is the bottle-neck of the SQP algorithm. To overcome this combinatorial expense, interior-point (IP) methods have been shown to solve large linear programs much faster than the standard simplex method. These interior-point techniques have also been extended to solve quadratic programming problems. For these reasons, we describe an IP method to solve the QP subproblem for rSQP at each iteration. The primal-dual interior-point method is described as well as some higher-order strategies designed to improve convergence. These higher order strategies are evaluated, and also a comparison of several linear equation solvers is made, since the solution of a linear system is required for each interior-point iteration. Finally, we evaluate and compare the new interior- point QP formulation with two standard active-set solvers, QPKWIK and QPOPT, on some industrial-strength NLP problems.},

abstract = {In this contribution, we address the efficient solution of optimal control problems of dynamic processes with many controls. Such problems arise, for example, from the outer convexification of integer control decisions. We treat this optimal control problem class using the direct multiple shooting method to discretize the optimal control problem. The resulting nonlinear problems are solved using sequential quadratic programming methods. We review the classical condensing algorithm that preprocesses the large but structured quadratic programs (QPs) to obtain small but dense ones. We show that this approach leaves room for improvement when applied in conjunction with outer convexification. To this end, we present a new complementary condensing algorithm for QPs with many controls. This algorithm is based on a hybrid null-space range-space approach to exploit the block structure of the QPs that is due to direct multiple shooting. An assessment of the theoretical run-time complexity reveals significant advantages of the proposed algorithm. We give a detailed account on the required number of floating point operations, depending on the process dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the merit of the new complementary condensing approach by comparing the behaviour of both methods for a vehicle control problem in which the integer gear decision is convexified. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Many process optimization problems consist of large numbers of equations and only a few degrees of freedom. To exploit this feature an implementation of the range and null space decomposition (RND) strategy for large-scale problems is described, with emphasis on the optimization of engineering systems. The RND technique for successive quadratic programming (SQP), as detailed in Vasantharajan and Biegler (Comput. chem. Engng 12, 1087-1101, 1988), is based on an inexpensive nonorthonormal decomposition. However, the original study evaluated a dense implementation. Here we discuss the incorporation of general-purpose sparse matrix techniques. Also, we consider safeguards for dealing with inconsistent linearizations and infeasible quadratic programs (QPs), which can compromise the robustness of this method. Here systematic ways of generating a nonsingular basis for general nonlinear programs are implemented to adapt this strategy to solve large, sparse problems efficiently. We describe an LP-based procedure which serves to partition the variables into decisions and dependents, thereby generating a nonsingular basis. Any redundancies/degeneracies in the constraints are also detected and processed separately. The reduced SQP implementation has been integrated into the modeling system, GAMS (Brooke et al., GAMS, A User's Guide, 1988). Finally, a comparison of the RND-based reduced SQP strategy with MINOS (Murtagh and Saunders, Minos/Augmented Supplementary User's Manual, 1978) is presented on a set of NLPs and process design problems. The process problems include the optimization of the operation of distillation columns. These problems warrant special mention as they have been implemented in a fully equation-oriented manner, thus exploiting the potential of the GAMS architecture. Results are presented that confirm the success of the reduced SQP implementation for efficient solution of large, difficult nonlinear programs. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

Three benchmark examples are solved with these formulations using the same input and output specifications and the same numerical optimization algorithm. A total of 35 different synthesis examples are imple- mented. The examples are limited to desired instantaneous output direction for prescribed input force direction. Hence, this study is limited to linear elastic modeling with small deformations. Two design parametrizations, namely, the frame element-based ground structure and the density approach using continuum elements, are used. The obtained designs are evaluated with all other objective functions and are compared with each other. The checkerboard patterns, point flexures, and the ability to converge from an unbiased uniform initial guess are analyzed. Some observations and recommendations are noted based on the extensive implementation done in this study. Complete details of the benchmark problems and the results are included.

abstract = {In this work, we explore simultaneous geometry design and material selection for statically determinate trusses by posing it as a continuous optimization problem. The underlying principles of our approach are structural optimization and Ashby's procedure for material selection from a database. For simplicity and ease of initial implementation, only static loads are considered in this work with the intent of maximum stiffness, minimum weight/cost, and safety against failure. Safety of tensile and compression members in the truss is treated differently to prevent yield and buckling failures, respectively. Geometry variables such as lengths and orientations of members are taken to be the design variables in an assumed layout. Areas of cross-section of the members are determined to satisfy the failure constraints in each member. Along the lines of Ashby's material indices, a new design index is derived for trusses. The design index helps in choosing the most suitable material for any geometry of the truss. Using the design index, both the design space and the material database are searched simultaneously using gradient-based optimization algorithms. The important feature of our approach is that the formulated optimization problem is continuous, although the material selection from a database is an inherently discrete problem. A few illustrative examples are included. It is observed that the method is capable of determining the optimal topology in addition to optimal geometry when the assumed layout contains more links than are necessary for optimality.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a tool for finding a domain in which material is placed that optimizes a certain objective function subject to constraints. This thesis considers topology optimization for structural mechanics problems, where the underlying PDE is derived from linear elasticity. There are two main approaches for solving topology optimization: Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation (SIMP) and Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO). SIMP is a continuous relaxation of the problem solved using a mathematical programming technique and so inherits the convergence properties of the optimization method. By contrast, ESO is based on engineering heuristics and has no proof of optimality. This thesis considers the formulation of the SIMP method as a mathematical optimization problem. Including the linear elasticity state equations is considered and found to be substantially less reliable and less efficient than excluding them from the formulation and solving the state equations separately. The convergence of the SIMP method under a regularising filter is investigated and shown to impede convergence. A robust criterion to stop filtering is proposed and demonstrated to work well in high-resolution problems (O(10{\^{}}6)). The ESO method is investigated to fully explain its non-monotonic convergence behaviour. Through a series of analytic examples, the steps taken by the ESO algorithm are shown to differ arbitrarily from a linear approximation. It is this difference between the linear approximation and the actual value taken which causes ESO to occasionally take non-descent steps. A mesh refinement technique has been introduced with the sole intention of reducing the ESO step size and thereby ensuring descent of the algorithm. This is shown to work on numerous examples. Extending the classical topology optimization problem to included a global buckling constraint is considered. This poses multiple computational challenges, including the introduction of numerically driven spurious localised buckling modes and ill-defined gradients in the case of non-simple eigenvalues. To counter such issues that arise in a continuous relaxation approach, a method for solving the problem that enforces the binary constraints is proposed. The method is designed specifically to reduce the number of derivative calculations made, which is by far the most computationally expensive step in optimization involving buckling. This method is tested on multiple problems and shown to work on problems of size O(10{\^{}}5).},

Some factors crucial for its fast performance are briefly reviewed. The direct multiple shooting approach has been successfully adapted to the specific requirements of real-time optimization. Special strategies have been developed to effectively minimize the on-line computational effort, in which the progress of the optimization iterations is nested with the progress of the process. They use precalculated information as far as possible (e.g. Hessians, gradients and QP presolves for iterated reference trajectories) to minimize response time in case of perturbations. In typical real-time problems they have proven much faster than fast off-line strategies. Compared with an optimal feedback control computable upper bounds for the loss of optimality can be established that are small in practice.

This strategy exploits solution information of the previous QP under the assumption that the active set does not change much from one QP to the next. Furthermore, we present a modification where the CPU time is limited in order to make it suitable for strict real-time applications. Its performance is demonstrated with a challenging test example comprising 240 variables and 1191 inequalities, which depends on 57 parameters and is prohibitive for explicit MPC approaches.

abstract = {Quadratic programs obtained for optimal control problems of dynamic or discrete-time processes usually involve highly block structured Hessian and constraints matrices, to be exploited by efficient numerical methods. In interior point methods, this is elegantly achieved by the widespread availability of advanced sparse symmetric indefinite factorization codes. For active set methods, however, conventional dense matrix techniques suffer from the need to update base matrices in every active set iteration, thereby loosing the sparsity structure after a few updates. This contribution presents a new factorization of a KKT matrix arising in active set methods for optimal control. It fully respects the block structure without any fill-in. For this factorization, matrix updates are derived for all cases of active set changes. This allows for the design of a highly efficient block structured active set method for optimal control and model predictive control problems with long horizons or many control parameters.},

abstract = {Abstract: The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is an instance of a successful application of the philosophy of bounded rationality and decentralized decision making for solving global optimization problems. A number of advantages with respect to other evolutionary algorithms are attributed to PSO making it a prospective candidate for optimum structural design. The PSO-based algorithm is robust and well suited to handle nonlinear, nonconvex design spaces with discontinuities, exhibiting fast convergence characteristics. Furthermore, hybrid algorithms can exploit the advantages of the PSO and gradient methods. This article presents in detail the basic concepts and implementation of an enhanced PSO algorithm combined with a gradient-based quasi-Newton sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method for handling structural optimization problems. The proposed PSO is shown to explore the design space thoroughly and to detect the neighborhood of the global optimum. Then the mathematical optimizer, starting from the best estimate of the PSO and using gradient information, accelerates convergence toward the global optimum. A nonlinear weight update rule for PSO and a simple, yet effective, constraint handling technique for structural optimization are also proposed. The performance, the functionality, and the effect of different setting parameters are studied. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in some benchmark structural optimization problems. The numerical results confirm the ability of the proposed methodology to find better optimal solutions for structural optimization problems than other optimization algorithms.},

It has non-smooth and non-convex characteristics when generation unit valve-point effects are taken into account. Environmental awareness and recent environmental policies have forced electric utilities to restructure their practices to account for their emission impacts. The dynamic economic/environmental dispatch problem is studied in the present analysis;this article proposes a hybrid approach. In the first stage,a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is employed to approximate the set of Pareto solutions through an evolutionary optimization process. In the subsequent stage,a multi-attribute decision-making approach is adopted to rank these solutions from best to worst and to determinate the best solution in a deterministic environment with a single decision-maker. This hybrid approach is tested on a ten-unit system to illustrate the analysis process. Pareto frontiers are obtained,and the ranking of Pareto solutions is based on entropy weight and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution. A single objective optimization example is also provided for comparison. Results obtained show that the hybrid approach has a great potential in handling the multi-objective optimization problem.},

The demand of both the ethylene and propylene has recently increased dramatically and naphtha pyrolysis is indispensable to satisfy the demand of both crucial products simultaneously, resulting in a typical multi-objective optimization problem. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), which has been successfully applied to many multi-objective optimization problems, cannot efficiently generate the Pareto set which spreads as widely as the true Pareto front in a limited time, meanwhile, its convergence process is rather slow and could not meet the speed requirement when used for the complicated industrial problem mentioned above. To efficiently solve the multi-objective optimization problem of the industrial complicated chemical processes, this paper first proposed a new parallel hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm combing NSGA-II with SQP (Successive Quadratic Programming) used to improve the efficiency of the NSGA-II and the quality of the Pareto-optimal set. Then the multi-objective operation optimization model of naphtha pyrolysis was established, and at last the application of the proposed algorithm to improve the performance of an industrial naphtha pyrolysis process was presented and analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The model, developed by Schartau and Oschlies, simulates the distribution of nitrogen, phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus in a water column and is driven by ocean circulation data. Our aim is to identify parameters and fit the model output to given observational data. For this model, it has been shown that a satisfactory fit could not be obtained, and that parameters with comparable fits can vary significantly. Since these results were obtained by evolutionary algorithms (EA), we used a wider range of optimization methods: A special type of EA (called quantum-EA) with coordinate line search and a quasi-Newton SQP method, where exact gradients were generated by Automatic/Algorithmic Differentiation. Both methods are parallelized and can be viewed as instances of a hybrid, mixed evolutionary and deterministic optimization algorithm that we present in detail. This algorithm provides a flexible and robust tool for parameter identification and model validation. We show how the obtained parameters depend on data sparsity and given data error. We present an uncertainty analysis of the optimized parameters w.r.t. Gaussian perturbed data. We show that the model is well suited for parameter identification if the data are attainable. On the other hand, the result that it cannot be fitted to the real observational data without extension or modification, is confirmed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Firstly, BSA is improved to enhance its convergent speed and the global search ability, by adopting the harmony search strategy and an adaptive amplitude control factor with individual optimum fitness feedback. Then, at the beginning stage of the hybrid search process, an initialization generator is constructed using IBSA to find a near optimum solution. When the change in fitness function approaches to a predefined value which is small enough, the search process is replaced by hpGPM to accelerate the search process and find an accurate solution. By this way, the hybrid algorithm is able to find a global optimum more quickly and accurately. Two NOC problems with CDC are examined using the proposed algorithm, and the corresponding Monte Carlo simulations are conducted. The comparison results show the hybrid algorithm achieves better performance in convergent speed, accuracy and robustness.},

Transportation sequence is the ordering of storage and retrieval jobs that a material handling device has to perform to finish an order list. In many studies, the optimization of transportation sequence has been simplified as an order-picking problem, and accordingly solved as a classical traveling salesman problem. However, transportation sequence is a double-cycle storage and retrieval problem (DCSRP) in itself, meaning that the combination of storage and retrieval jobs into double cycles has to be considered simultaneously. In this paper, we propose formulating the DCSRP as a permutation problem and applying several genetic algorithms to solve the formulated problem.

The experimental analysis confirms that our approach could solve the problem efficiently on the one hand, and addresses the question of which genetic operators are best applied to the formulated DCSRP on the other hand. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

To meet this need, a method is introduced to acquire the finest possible performance. A series of computations are carried out to formulate the grain geometry in terms of various combinations of key shapes inclusive of ellipsoid, cone, cylinder, sphere, torus, and inclined plane. A hybrid optimization (HO) technique is established by associating genetic algorithm (GA) for global solution convergence with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for further local convergence of the solution, thus achieving the final optimal design.

The optimization problem used in this study involves maximization of a non-dimensional correlation consisting of Nusselt number and pressure drop with Reynolds and Richardson number which are used as design constraints. The methodology implemented within an integrated environment involving Matlab, Gambit and Fluent. The results obtained show that heat transfer enhancement has a direct relationship with the nanoparticle concentration ratio whereas it has inverse relationship with the operational temperature. In addition, the results show that the proposed methodology provides an effective way of solving thermal analysis in a solar parabolic trough collectors based on simulation models.},

abstract = {This article presents a method to design and optimize 3D FINOCYL grain (FCG) configuration for solid rocket motors (SRMs). The design process of FCG configuration involves mathematical modeling of the geometry and parametric evaluation of various independent geometric variables that define the complex configuration. Virtually infinite combinations of these variables will satisfy the requirements of mass of propellant, thrust, and burning time in addition to satisfying basic needs for volumetric loading fraction and web fraction. In order to ensure the acquisition of the best possible design to be acquired, a sound approach of design and optimization is essentially demanded. To meet this need, a method is introduced to acquire the finest possible performance. A series of computations are carried out to formulate the grain geometry in terms of various combinations of key shapes inclusive of ellipsoid, cone, cylinder, sphere, torus, and inclined plane. A hybrid optimization (HO) technique is established by associating genetic algorithm (GA) for global solution convergence with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for further local convergence of the solution, thus achieving the final optimal design. A comparison of the optimal design results derived from SQP, GA, and HO algorithms is presented. By using HO technique, the parameter of propellant mass is optimized to the minimum value with the required level of thrust staying within the constrained burning time, nozzle and propellant parameters, and a fixed length and outer diameter of grain.},

In this paper, we present a novel method that exploits the structure of linear dynamical systems, and the monotonicity of the exponential function in order to obtain safety certificates of continuous linear systems. By over-approximating the sets of initial and final states, the safety verification problem is expressed as a series of geometric programs which can be further transformed into linear programs. This provides the ability to verify the safety properties of high dimensional linear systems with realistic computation times. In addition, our optimization based formulation computes time intervals over which the system is safe and unsafe.},

We pro-pose to formulate the problem holistically as a 1st-order logic extension of a mathematical program: a non-linear constrained program over the full world trajectory where the symbolic state-action sequence defines the (in-)equality constraints. We tackle the challenge of solving such programs by proposing three levels of approximation: The coarsest level introduces the concept of the effective end state kinematics, parametrically describing all possible end state configurations conditional to a given sym-bolic action sequence. Optimization on this level is fast and can inform symbolic search. The other two levels optimize over interaction keyframes and eventually over the full world trajectory across in-teractions.

abstract = {We analyze the allocation of objects in a network of caches which collaborate to service requests from customers. A thorough analysis of this problem in centralized and decentralized setups, both of which occur in practice, is essential for understanding the benefits of collaboration. A key insight of this paper is that an efficient implementation of cooperative cache management is possible since, in the centralized scenario, the object allocation resulting in the best social welfare can be found easily as a solution to a transportation problem. For the decentralized scenario involving selfish caches, it is shown that pure equilibria exist and that the cache network always reaches a pure equilibrium in a finite number of steps starting from any point in the strategy space. An auction mechanism is developed to derive prices that incentivize the caches to hold objects in a manner such that the optimal social welfare is attained. In the special case of symmetric caches, simple algorithms are devised to find the optimal social welfare allocation, the best pure equilibrium, and the prices for sharing objects. The results obtained in this paper should be valuable in developing and evaluating cache management policies. Resource-sharing problems with a similar cost structure exist in a variety of other domains, and the insights gained here are expected to extend to those scenarios as well.},

Branch and Bound (BB) is an exact general search algorithm for COPs solving. BB is the most usual algorithm in the mono-objective case. The efficiency of BB depends on its hability to detect dead-ends, that is, nodes that do not have any solution below. Dead-end detection is done with a heuristic function that computes an underestimation or lower bound of the current subproblem. In recent years, many heuristic functions have been proposed. For instance, all weighted CSP local consistencies can be used for this purpose. Another alternative is Mini-bucket elimination (MBE). MBE is a generic inference method well-known in Constraint Programming. It computes a lower bound of the optimal solution (assuming minimization). Therefore, MBE is usually used inside BB to improve its pruning capability.},

abstract = {superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to reduce the minimum voltage and to increase the maximum speed under certain conditions, but there are some harmful side-effects. First of all, the electrostatic pressure can push water into the surface pores, which hinders actuation. The phenomenon can also be treated as a vertical electrowetting effect. Another drawback is that the use of superhydrophobic surfaces makes actuation more critical to the properties of the liquid. For example, actuation of biological buffer solutions was not successful. For these reasons, it is concluded that it is more beneficial to use a smooth surface with low hysteresis than a superhydrophobic surface in droplet actuation. Electrostatic droplet actuation is a potential method for manipulating liquid on a microscopic scale, but there is still work to do. This work contains a detailed examination of the droplet actuation mechanism, and trapping of charges in the solid-liquid interface is found to be the most severe problem that needs to be solved.},

Compared to single-objective optimization problems, the situation becomes more difficult for multi-objective engineering optimization problems under uncertainty. Multi-objective robust optimization (MORO) approaches have been developed to find Pareto robust solutions. While the literature reports on many techniques in MORO, few papers focus on using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) for robust optimization (RO) and performance improvement of its solutions. In this article, MODE is first modified and developed for RO problems with interval uncertainty, formulating a new MODE-RO algorithm. To improve the solutions' quality of MODE-RO, a new hybrid (MODE-sequential quadratic programming (SQP)-RO) algorithm is proposed further, where SQP is incorporated into the procedure to enhance the local search. The proposed hybrid approach takes the advantage of MODE for its capability of handling not-well behaved robust constraint functions and SQP for its fast local convergence. Two numerical and one engineering examples, with two or three objective functions, are tested to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed algorithms. The results show that MODE-RO is effective in solving MORO problems while, on the average, MODE-SQP-RO improves the quality of robust solutions obtained by MODE-RO with comparable numbers of function evaluations.},

The proposed algorithm combines the global but slow search of PSO with the rapid but local search capabilities of BB, to simultaneously achieve an improved optimization accuracy and a reduced requirement for computational resources. It is capable of handling arbitrary continuous and discrete constraints without the use of a penalty function, which is frequently cumbersome to parameterize. At the same time, it maintains a simple, generic, and easy-to-implement architecture, and it is based on the sequential quadratic programming for solving the NLP subproblems in the BB tree. The performance of the new hybrid PSO-BB architecture algorithm is evaluated against real-world MDNLP benchmark problems, and it is found to be highly competitive compared with existing algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new hybrid optimization approach, which combines multiple optimization algorithms. To develop an efficient hybrid optimization algorithm, it is nec- essary to determine how the optimization process is performed. This paper focuses on the balance between local and broad searches, and multiple optimization methods are controlled to derive both the optimum point and the information of the land- scape. By this approach, we can describe the global landscape after derivation of optimization. To achieve the proposed opti- mization strategy, three distinguished optimization algorithms are introduced: DIRECT (DIviding RECTangles), GAs (Genetic Algorithms), and SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming). To integrate these three algorithms, each algorithm, especially DIRECT, was modified and developed. The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm was examined through numerical experiments. From these experiments, not only the optimum point but also the information of the landscape was determined. The information of the landscape verified the reliability of optimization results.},

In the hybrid GA-SQP the role of the GA is to explore the search place in order to either isolate the most promising region of the search space. The role of the SQP is to exploit the information gathered by the GA. To demonstrate the usefulness of the presented approach, two cases for parameter identification of different complexity are considered. The hybrid scheme is applied for modeling of E. coli MC4110 fed-batch cultivation process.

abstract = {The meta-heuristic methods are very efficient for the search of global solution for complex problems better than deterministic methods. However meta-heuristic methods, have the disadvantage of convergence time, which is due to the high number of agents and iterations. To solve this problem we have combined two meta-heuristic methods, the GA and the PSO with a classical method SQP. The proposed hybrid method performs the first step with a global search using the method of PSO on the best 10 {\%} among the members of the population of the genetic algorithm. On the other hand, other operators of GA are applied to the remaining 90 {\%} of the population. In the second step, a conventional method (SQP) is applied, to give a final value with high precision and accuracy. Since the work is done step by step around the approximate solution, the proposed approach is applied for solving a multi-objective problem in order to achieve the set of optimal solutions and best compromising solution between the cost function and emission function. In this work, this technique is used on a power network, in which wind energy was injected. To validate the robustness of the proposed approach, the proposed algorithm is tested on the norme IEEE 30-bus and on the Algerian 59-bus electrical network. Comparison of the results with recent global optimization methods show the superiority of the proposed approach and confirm its potential for solving practical optimal power flow in terms of solution quality and convergence characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2013, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

abstract = {The design of strategies for branching in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is guided by cycles of parameter tun-ing and offline experimentation on an extremely heteroge-neous testbed, using the average performance. Once devised, these strategies (and their parameter settings) are essentially input-agnostic. To address these issues, we propose a ma-chine learning (ML) framework for variable branching in MIP. Our method observes the decisions made by Strong Branching (SB), a time-consuming strategy that produces small search trees, collecting features that characterize the candidate branching variables at each node of the tree. Based on the collected data, we learn an easy-to-evaluate surrogate function that mimics the SB strategy, by means of solving a learning-to-rank problem, common in ML. The learned ranking function is then used for branching. The learning is instance-specific, and is performed on-the-fly while executing a branch-and-bound search to solve the instance. Experiments on benchmark instances indicate that our method produces significantly smaller search trees than existing heuristics, and is competitive with a state-of-the-art commercial solver.},

Extended formulations have been used by Vielma, Ahmed and Nemhauser (2008) and Hijazi, Bonami and Ouorou (2013) to construct algorithms for MICQP that can provide a significant computational advantage. The first approach is based on an extended or lifted polyhedral relaxation of the Lorentz cone by Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (2001) that is extremely economical, but whose approximation quality cannot be iteratively improved. The second is based on a lifted polyhedral relaxation of the euclidean ball that can be constructed using techniques introduced by Tawarmalani and Sahinidis (2005). This relaxation is less economical, but its approximation quality can be iteratively improved. Unfortunately, while the approach of Vielma, Ahmed and Nemhauser is applicable for general MICQP problems, the approach of Hijazi, Bonami and Ouorou can only be used for MICQP problems with convex quadratic constraints. In this paper we show how a homogenization procedure can be combined with the technique by Tawarmalani and Sahinidis to adapt the extended formulation used by Hijazi, Bonami and Ouorou to a class of conic mixed integer programming problems that include general MICQP problems. We then compare the effectiveness of this new extended formulation against traditional and extended formulation-based algorithms for MICQP. We find that this new formulation can be used to improve various LP-based algorithms. In particular, the formulation provides an easy-to-implement procedure that, in our benchmarks, significantly improved the performance of commercial MICQP solvers.},

State-of-the-art procedures base the selection of variables on their "LP gains", which is the dual bound improvement obtained after branching on a variable. There are various ways of selecting variables depending on their LP gains. However, all methods are evaluated empirically. In this paper we present a theoretical model for the selection of branching variables. It is based upon an abstraction of MIPs to a simpler setting in which it is possible to analytically evaluate the dual bound improvement of choosing a given variable. We then discuss how the analytical results can be used to choose branching variables for MIPs, and we give experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on MIPLIB 2010 "tree" instances where we achieve a 5{\%} geometric average time and node improvement over the default rule of SCIP, a state-of-the-art MIP solver.},

Unfortunately, this approach is prone to instability. In this paper we analyze a different scheme for the generation of rank-1 GMICs read from a basis of the original LP—the one before the addition of any cut.We adopt a relax-and-cut approach where the generated GMICs are not added to the current LP, but immediately relaxed in a Lagrangian fashion. Various elaborations of the basic idea are presented, that lead to very fast—yet accurate—variants of the basic scheme. Very encouraging computational results are presented, with a comparison with alternative techniques from the literature also aimed at improving the GMIC quality.

In the intervening 48 years, SQP methods have evolved into a powerful and effective class of methods for a wide range of optimization problems. We review some of the most prominent developments in SQP methods since 1963 and discuss the relationship of SQP methods to other popular methods, including augmented Lagrangian methods and interior methods. Given the scope and utility of nonlinear optimization, it is not surprising that SQP methods are still a subject of active research. Recent developments in methods for mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and the minimization of functions subject to differential equation constraints has led to a heightened interest in methods that may be " warm started " from a good approximate solution. We discuss the role of SQP methods in these contexts.},

The underlying algorithms are based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP)with stabilization by trust-regions, linear outer approximations, and branch-and-bound techniques.The mixed-integer quadratic programming subproblems are solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm. Second order information is updated by a quasi-Newton update formula (BFGS) applied to the Lagrange function for continuous, but also for integer variables. We do not require that the model functions can be evaluated at fractional values of the integer variables. Thus, partial derivatives with respect to integer variables are replaced by descent directions obtained from function values at neighboring grid points, and the number of simulations or function evaluations, respectively, is our main performance criterion to measure the efficiency of a code. Numerical results are presented for a set of 100 academic mixed-integer test problems. Since not all of our test examples are convex, we reach the best-known solutions in about 90{\%}of the test runs, but at least feasible solutions in the other cases. The average number of function evaluations of the new mixed-integer SQP code is between 240 and 500 including those needed for one- or two-sided approximations of partial derivatives or descent directions, respectively. In addition, we present numerical results for a set of 55 test problemswith some practical background in petroleum engineering. Keywords},

A method is proposed that is based on finding an approximate solution of a sequence of unconstrained subproblems parameterized by a scalar parameter. The objective function of each unconstrained subproblem is an augmented penalty-barrier function that involves both primal and dual variables. Each subproblem is solved with a modified Newton method that generates search directions from a primal-dual system similar to that proposed for interior methods. The augmented penalty-barrier function may be interpreted as a merit function for values of the primal and dual variables. An inertia-controlling symmetric indefinite factorization is used to provide descent directions and directions of negative curvature for the augmented penalty-barrier merit function. A method suitable for large problems can be obtained by providing a version of this factorization that will treat large sparse indefinite systems.},

The optical properties of the phantoms were chosen to mimic those of PWS skin. We denoised acoustic waves using spline wavelet transforms, then deconvolved with the impulse response of the probe to yield initial subsurface pressure distributions in phantoms and PWS skin. Using the phantoms, we determined that the limit in resolving epidermal and PWS layers was less than 70 microm. In addition, we used the phantoms to determine that the maximum epidermal melanin concentration that allowed detection of PWS was between 13 and 20{\%}. In vivo measurements of PWS skin with different epidermal melanin concentrations correlated with the phantoms. Thus the photoacoustic probe can be used to determine PWS depth for most patients receiving laser therapy.},

@article{Newton,
abstract = {F.1 Introduction In this Appendix we present a framework for developing polynomial-time algorithms for the solution of convex optimization problems. The approach is based on an interior-point barrier method. Key to this framework is the assumption that the barrier function is " self concordant, " a property that we define below. For linear constraints, the ordinary logarithmic barrier function can be used. It is possible to prove that, for any convex feasible region with the properties we specify below, there exists an appropriate self-concordant barrier function. Thus the results we describe here provide a general theoretical approach for solving convex programming problems. The interior-point method utilizes Newton's method. We derive a bound on the number of Newton iterations required to determine the optimal function value to within some tolerance. Each Newton iteration involves the solution of the Newton equations, requiring O(n 3) computations. A prescribed step length is used, so there is no line search. Ignoring the computations for evaluating the gradient and Hessian, the algorithm determines the solution to within a specified tolerance in a polynomial number of operations. If polynomial algorithms exist to evaluate the gradient and Hessian, the overall algorithm is polynomial. Two major results are required to prove that the overall algorithm is a poly-nomial algorithm. The first states that if Newton's method is applied to a single barrier subproblem, and the initial guess is " close " to the solution, then the number of iterations required to find an approximate solution of this subproblem is bounded. The second states that, if the barrier parameter is not changed too quickly, then an approximate solution of one subproblem will not be " too far " from the solution of the next subproblem. These two results might at first seem to be obvious. They are not. In the form that we state the convex programming problem, its solution is usually at the boundary of the feasible region. The barrier function is singular on the boundary of the feasible region, and so the Hessian of the barrier function becomes ill-conditioned 767},

Here, each agent solves its own small-scale nonlinear programming problem and communicates with other agents by solving coupled quadratic programming problems. These coupled quadratic programming problems have equality constraints for which parallelizable methods are available.

Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit de- sign, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an en- gineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do GP modeling.We start with the basic definitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into GP format.We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with GP, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with GP (when this is possible).We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of GP, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them.},

abstract = {Many methods for solving generalized geometric programming (GGP) problem can only find locally optimal solutions. But up to now, less work has been devoted to solving global optimization of GGP due to the inherent difficulty. This paper gives a method for finding the globally optimal solutions of GGP. Utilizing an exponentially variable transformation and some other techniques the initial nonlinear and nonconvex GGP problem is reduced to a sequence of linear programming problems. The proposed algorithm is proven that it is convergent to the global minimum through the solutions of a series of linear programming problems. Several GGP examples in the literatures are tested to demonstrate that the proposed method can systematically solve these examples to find the global optimum within a prespecified error. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Many methods have been provided for finding locally optimal solutions of SGP, but little progress has been made for global optimization of SGP. In this paper we propose a new accelerating method for global optimization algorithm of SGP using a suitable deleting technique. This technique offers a possibility to cut away a large part of the currently investigated region in which the globally optimal solution of SGP does not exist, and can be seen as an accelerating device for global optimization algorithm of SGP problem. Compared with the method of Shen and Zhang [Global optimization of signomial geometric programming using linear relaxation, Appl. Math.

abstract = {Facility layout design (FLD) has a very important effect on the performance of a manufacturing system. The concept of FLD is usually considered as a multiobjective problem. For this reason, a layout generation and its evaluation are often challenging and time consuming due to their inherent multiple objectives in nature and their data collection process. In addition, an effective facility layout evaluation procedure necessitates the consideration of qualitative criteria, e.g., flexibility in volume and variety and quality related to the product and production, as well as quantitative criteria such as material handling cost, adjacency score, shape ratio, and material handling vehicle utilization in the decision process. This paper presents a decision-making methodology based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), which uses both quantitative and qualitative criteria, for evaluating FLD. The criteria that are to be minimized are viewed as inputs whereas the criteria to be maximized are considered as outputs. A computer-aided layout-planning tool, VisFactory, is adopted to facilitate the layout alternative design process as well as to collect quantitative data by using exact and vague data by means of fuzzy set theory. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is then applied to collect qualitative data related to quality and flexibility. The DEA methodology is used to solve the layout design problem by simultaneously considering both the quantitative and qualitative data. The purposed integrated procedure is applied to a real data set of a case study, which consists of 19 FLDs provided of the plastic profile production system.},

A frequent objective when designing a network strategy is to determine the least total cost system design such that all customer demand is satisfied subject to limitations imposed by production capacities for plants and storage capacities for warehouses. We present a mixed integer programming model, PLANWAR, and provide an efficient heuristic solution procedure for this supply chain management problem. Distribution system design problems commonly occurs in the following form: A number of production plants supply warehouses with multiple products which in turn distribute these products to customer outlets based on their specified demand quantities of the different products. It is required to select the optimum set of plants and warehouses from a potential set and plan production capacities, warehouse capacities and quantities shipped so that the total operating costs of the distribution network are minimized. This paper is a computational study to investigate the value of coordinating production and distribution planning.

Therefore, the effects of different design parameters, i.e. SOI (start of injection), DOI (duration of injection) and spray angle, on the entropy generation response surface are investigated in detail. Various methods of optimization such as MOGA (multi-objective Genetic algorithm), MOSA (multi-objective simulated annealing), MOPSO (multi-objective particle swarm optimization) and NSGA (non-sorted Genetic algorithm) are used and compared. It is observed that among the design parameters, SOI is the most important parameter influencing the first law efficiency and emission while spray angle is the least important one. Also, it is found that DOI has the strongest impact on the second law efficiency. The most fitting error relates to response surface of the second law efficiency since, compared to the other objectives, it shows a much more complex behavior and changes nonlinearly with the change in design parameters.},

After investigating the effect of the Swirl number on each objective through response surfaces and sensitivity analysis, the optimal case is introduced by the decision making process.

Since the arrangement of the density points is unnecessarily associated with the analysis mesh in the topology optimization based on analysis-separated density interpolation, the refinements of each field can be separately implemented. Here, the analysis mesh is refined to improve the computational accuracy of the displacement field and the associated strain field within certain local regions (e.g. the regions around concentrated loading points and displacement restrictions), while the density field is refined in the regions between fully solid and void phases to improve the geometrical description quality of design boundaries. With such a strategy, the refinements of the analysis mesh and the density field are naturally separated and not bond together anymore. Actually, each refinement process is independently performed only when and where necessary. Numerical examples show that the proposed method can achieve high-quality and high-accuracy optimal solutions comparable to those obtained with fixed globally fine analysis meshes and fine distributed density points, but with much less computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis mesh-independent density field, interpolated by the nodal design variables at a given set of density points, is adaptively refined/coarsened according to a criterion regarding the gray-scale measure of local regions. New density points are added into the gray regions and redundant ones are removed from the regions occupied by purely solid/void phases for decreasing the number of design variables. A penalization factor adaptivity technique is employed to prevent premature convergence of the optimization iterations. Such an adaptive scheme not only improves the structural boundary description quality, but also allows for sufficient further topological evolution of the structural layout in higher adaptivity levels and thus essentially enables high-resolution solutions. Moreover, compared with the case with uniformly and finely distributed density points, the proposed adaptive method can achieve a higher numerical efficiency of the optimization process. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics; Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
